# # EPL Player Rating Model 

# This program is a meant to rate players in the **_English Premier League_**. The ratings are based off of individual player performances and their contributions for the respective sides. More on the rating methodology used will follow. All the match data that is used was scraped from [whoscored](https://www.whoscored.com) and the data is published at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhmamp/english-premier-league-match-data)

# Now comes the explanation for rating model used. The method used to rate players is based on pretty simple concepts. All game outcomes are determined by the number of goals scored by each team. For example, if **Team-A** scores more than **Team-B**, **Team-A** wins, and if **Team-B** scores more than **Team-A**, **Team-B** wins. The game is a draw if the scores are tied. Elementry, you would say! Turns out this is the most important point in our model. The only ground truth.
# 
# So how do we go about rating players based on this. Think about it this way, if all outcomes are based on the number of goals scored (by a given team and it's opposition) and nothing else. If we find a relationship between each of the player contributions and goals scored (or conceded), we can objectively rate each player on the affect the player had for a team in the game.
# 
# So here goes the model. All goals are a _Poisson_ distributed as regards to the number of shots taken. That is if there are _n_ shots **on target**, the ball goes in the back of the net with mean _mu_. So, to find the number of goals all that remains to be figured are these 2 variables -- _n_, _shots on target_. 
# 
# The toal shots are **assumed** to be a linear function of certain variables -- contests won, accurate passes, opposition tackles, aerials won, opposition yellow and red cards. This assumption might not be true but I will just wing it.
# 
# Shots on target is a game of chance. With probabilty p, any given shot is a shot on target. We estimate this p based on historical data. Again, may not be a reasonable assumption, but who the hell cares, atleast I know the limitations of my model.
# 
# So what happenned to rating players again!. Well it turns out that, (by not a lot of mathematical genius and persistent hardwork) player rating is the change in probability of winning caused by the player with his contributions. To put it in the words of Newton, it is the sum of partial derivatives of the estimated score-line with respect to each of the player's contributions. Phew! don't even get me started with explaination. Go figure.

# We are almost at the end of our journey. Using the data that we structured and theory that I just explained along with an extremely rigorous code that I wrote elsewhere, we can get to the player ratings. If you were not able to follow along, too bad.
