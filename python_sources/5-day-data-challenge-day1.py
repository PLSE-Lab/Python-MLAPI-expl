# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import zipfile

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input/80-cereals"]).decode("utf8"))
#zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile("../input/80-cereals", 'r')
#zip_ref.extractall("../input")
#zip_ref.close()

data = pd.read_csv("../input/80-cereals/cereal.csv")
data.describe()
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
