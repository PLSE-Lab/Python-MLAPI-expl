"""
o All we need is a project id --- that has a billing information ---

There is Google Cloud Platform Free Tier.
I have previously signed up for the free trial -- its 12-month period has passed, and no remaining of the $300 in credit left.
But Always Free allows the use of AutoML Tables up to 6 node hours.

Upgrading allows to access Always Free, which activates the billing information.
Then, create a new project tied with that billing info.
GCP set a project id that should be specified in the cell below.

o Activate APIs as well (Step 4 in https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/get-started-with-google-cloud-platform).
