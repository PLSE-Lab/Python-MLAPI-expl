def cleanup3(X):

    Fixes the categorical features. 
    
    
    Each feature has different specific problems, but they usually have
    garbage values (usually 'unknown') that should really be read as NANs.
    
    This function cleans up garbage, clusters together different labels
    that should be equivalent but are coded differently (e.g., different
    spellings of the same thing), and removes labels with so few members
    that they're unlikely to be informative.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : pandas.DataFrame
        DF with raw categorical features, except for the changes
        already included in cleanup1.
    
    Returns
    ----------
    X2 : pandas.DataFrame
         DF with cleaned categorical features.
