#IDEA:
"""The idea is to build a model which is trained on a series of song lyrics and then use it to generate further lyrics with some input.
For example, the model will take a small string from the user (Like: Happy Birthday to you) and
then it will try to generate the lyrics starting from this line!
For this purpose, I'm using a Keras based RNN, i.e., Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) for genrating lyrics,
which will differ in each case and will also memorize or learns from the past predictions.

I'm using Keras with Tensorflow as backened. Keras lets us to create and solve our problems in an object oriented way.
So, there are basically two dependencies for this kernel, viz., Keras & Tensorflow.

# There is also a program named "Helper.py" included in the kernel as data, which is used for performing some very important functions.
# So, let's get started.

# Gathering Lyric data from "55000+ Song Lyrics" and convrting it into plain text for training the model.

#Opening the file (SONGDATA.csv) for extracting the text.

    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Opening DATA.py file for writing the training data in it.

        text = row[3]
