Problem Statement:-
A TV cable service provider has 170 customers distributed over 8 km radius. The service provider
wishes to restrict his services over 2km radius and retain maximum number of customers possible.
The remaining customers will be transferred to other service providers. Estimate the new position
of the base station (Assuming the current position of the service provider as (0,0)), and the
customers who can avail the services by the service provider. The data of customer ID and their
corresponding position is provided.

Tasks:
Design an algorithm to generate a list of customers to be retained and the list of customers to
be transferred.
Plot the graph of initial data and processed data, so that we can present the visualization of
the developed algorithm to the service provider.
