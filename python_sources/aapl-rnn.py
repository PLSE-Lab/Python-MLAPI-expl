# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# 
# how many samples the model sees before it updates the weights
# smaller batch size (e.g 1) will make the fitting speed very slow and large batch size will stop the model from generalizing well

# 
# how many days in the past do you want to look at in order to make a prediction (e.g the data from the previous 7 days "week")
