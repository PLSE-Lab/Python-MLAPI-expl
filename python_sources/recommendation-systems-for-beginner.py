# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# import movie data set and look at columns
movie = pd.read_csv("../input/movie.csv")
movie.columns


# In[ ]:


# what we need is that movie id and title
movie = movie.loc[:,["movieId","title"]]
movie.head(10)


# In[ ]:


# import rating data and look at columsn
rating = pd.read_csv("../input/rating.csv")
rating.columns


# In[ ]:


# what we need is that user id, movie id and rating
rating = rating.loc[:,["userId","movieId","rating"]]
rating.head(10)


# In[ ]:


# then merge movie and rating data
data = pd.merge(movie,rating)


# In[ ]:


# now lets look at our data 
data.head(10)


# In[ ]:


data.shape


# In[ ]:


data = data.iloc[:1000000,:]


# In[ ]:


# lets make a pivot table in order to make rows are users and columns are movies. And values are rating
pivot_table = data.pivot_table(index = ["userId"],columns = ["title"],values = "rating")
pivot_table.head(10)


# In[ ]:


movie_watched = pivot_table["Bad Boys (1995)"]
similarity_with_other_movies = pivot_table.corrwith(movie_watched)  # find correlation between "Bad Boys (1995)" and other movies
similarity_with_other_movies = similarity_with_other_movies.sort_values(ascending=False)
similarity_with_other_movies.head()


# In[ ]:


movie_watched = pivot_table["Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)"]
similarity_with_other_movies = pivot_table.corrwith(movie_watched)  # find correlation between "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) " and other movies
similarity_with_other_movies = similarity_with_other_movies.sort_values(ascending=False)
similarity_with_other_movies.head()


# ## Conclusion
# * What we learn is that
# * User based recommentation systems
# * Item based recommentation systems
# * How to find correlation or similarity between two vectors
# * Then we make very basic movie recommendation system.
