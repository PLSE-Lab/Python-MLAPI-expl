# Ways to help us select how many components should we include.
# In our recipe, we included only two. The following are a
# list of ways to select the components more empirically:

# The Eigenvalue criterion:
# An Eigenvalue of one would mean that the component would explain about one
# variable's worth of variability. So, according to this criterion, a component should
# at least explain one variable's worth of variability. We can say that we will include
# only those Eigenvalues whose value is greater than or equal to one. Based on our
# data set we can set the threshold. In a very large dimensional dataset including
# components capable of explaining only one variable may not be very useful.
