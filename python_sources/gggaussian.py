# I want to play with Gaussian Process Classification with a Radial Basis Function kernel. I will drop colour as a feature as there doesn't appear to be a correlation between colour and type in the training sample.

y_train = train["type"].map({"Ghoul": 1, "Ghost": 2, "Goblin": 3})


train.drop("type", inplace=True, axis=1)

train_test = pd.concat([train, test], axis=0)

# drop 'color'
train_test = train_test.drop('color', 1)

X_train = train_test.iloc[:len(y_train)].as_matrix()
X_test  = train_test.iloc[len(y_train):].as_matrix()
y_train = y_train.transpose().as_matrix()

# OK now for the guts of the classifier

kernel = 1.0 * RBF([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
gpc = GaussianProcessClassifier(kernel)
gpc.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = gpc.predict(X_test)

# Now write out the predictions to a file
