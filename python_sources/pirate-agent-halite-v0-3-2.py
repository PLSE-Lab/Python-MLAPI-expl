# # Pirate Agent
# 
# The end result of this notebook is an agent whose ships almost always attack enemy ships.  It is an attempt to see if the rules that were updated as part of the kaggle-environments 0.3.2 release can be exploited.
# 
# For all of this code in a single file see https://gist.github.com/hubcity/36fcf4a19d1fe33f0f07b01506e6bcde
# 
# The overall structure of this notebook was inspired by the [Halite BoilerBot](https://www.kaggle.com/superant/halite-boilerbot).

# ## Rules
# 
# This section contains simple rules for when to convert and spawn and for how to move around the board.  These rules do at most one convert and at most one spawn per turn.
# 
# Convert Rules
# * if possible have at least one shipyard
# * have one shipyard for every 5 ships
# * build the shipyard with the ship with largest cargo
# * don't build where a shipyard already exists
# * if this is the last ship don't build a shipyard unless you will have enough halite to replace the ship
# 
# Spawn Rules:
# * spawn if collecting an average amount of halite would make it worthwhile
# 
# Movement Rules:
# * move closer to the goal unless you would collide with your own ship

# ## Goals
# 
# Ships are assigned the goal of depositing halite to the closest shipyard when they have met the cargo minimum.  The remaining ships are assigned goals using [linear_sum_assignment](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html) from scipy.  (See the [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) and the polynomial time solution, the [Hungarian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm).)
