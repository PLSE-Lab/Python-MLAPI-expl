# This notebook creates US College Sailing Rankings using Trueskill. It's ranking the best team in the fleeting racing for the 2016-17 season.

# ###Load Libraries

# In[ ]:


#pandas is a library that allows you to manipulate data in "data frames". 
#Very helpful when dealing with data
import pandas as pd 

import numpy as np

#Trueskill is the function that does the ranking. 
#It's the algorithm Microsoft Research developed to rank XBox players.
#Great summary at: http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html
