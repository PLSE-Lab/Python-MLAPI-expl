# Good morning, Mr. Truong.
# Today is the last day of our first summer camp event.
# I hope you've learned quite a lot about us. What's our name again?
# I don't... Just kidding (saw a frown from bigquery, telling me that I'd better me serious before having a punch in my gut). BIGQUERYYYY!
# Thanks for doing that. Unlike Bob, we're very serious about doing something. Remember, the fun only comes in after the work, not the other way around.
# Ok, ok. What's your point?
# Well, today we are learning more about GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
# You already know what they do--good job on that, so I'd like you to figure which Hacker News comments generated the most discussion?
# Ok (I don't know who's the boss of who now...)

# Good job, Mr. Truong.
# With this, we can conclude our summer camp event, session 1. I look forward to seeing you in the next session.
# And don't forget to do the exercises and practice data wrangling.
