# To design this recommender system I used the ideas from the following article:
# 
# https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-recommender-systems-works-python-code-850a770a656b
# 
# Since user data was not available, I used the attributes information for each artist instead.
# 
# The system takes input of a user preferred artist, and then recommends artists that highly correlate with the preferred artist based on the artist attributes.
# 
# For more than one user preferred artist, the system goes one by one, and finds artists that highly correlate to each user preferred artist. Any duplicates are removed and then the remaining artists are recommended.

# # Set Up

# In[ ]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#reading the artists with genres file:
df=pd.read_csv("../input/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks/data_w_genres.csv")
df.artists.str.strip()
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='artists',keep=False)

#removing attributes that are not required for recommending:
df.drop(['count','duration_ms','key','mode','genres'],axis=1,inplace=True)

#Standardizing columns so that the min value is zero and max value is 1:
df['tempo'] = df['tempo']/217.743000
df['loudness'] = (df['loudness'] + 60)/61.342
df['liveness'] = df['liveness']/0.991
df['acousticness'] = df['acousticness']/0.996
df['danceability'] = df['danceability']/0.986
df['speechiness'] = df['speechiness']/0.964
df['valence'] = df['valence']/0.999
df['popularity'] = df['popularity']/97

#converting df from wide to long:
df2=pd.melt(df,id_vars=['artists'],var_name='song_features', value_name='values')

#creating a table with each artist as a separate column and each row as a separate attribute:
art_mat=df2.pivot_table(index="song_features",columns="artists",values="values")
