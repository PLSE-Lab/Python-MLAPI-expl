# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Reading data
# Train data
traindata = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', header = 0, dtype={'Age': np.float64})

# Test data
testdata  = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv' , header = 0, dtype={'Age': np.float64})

#Print to standard output, and see the results in the "log" section below after running your script
print("\n\nTop of the training data:")
print(traindata.head())
print(testdata.shape)
