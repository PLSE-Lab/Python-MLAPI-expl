# **An Introductory Attempt at NNETS on March Madness**
# The first section of this notebook transforms the raw dataset (team statistics for each regular season game for all the years that the NCAA Basketball Tournament was run) into per-game season average statistics for every team that played in the tournament. In this way, we hoped to use regular season stats as a rudimentary predictor for post-season success and hoped to artificially explore patterns within these statistics using the machine learning technique of nerual networks (both implemented in the Python libraries Tensorflow and Keras).   
# To establish a base-line (which hopefully our neural networks should have surpassed) we ran a logistics regression on the data set and found a test-set accuracy of 66%. Unfortunately, neither of our nnet implementations were able to surpass that number despite lots of tweaking. The best conclusion that we can come up with is that there is something fundamentally spurious about the use of vectorized team statistics to determine win probabilities and that somehow the input data should be restructured or that a composite score should be calculated or that multivariable regression could help us pair down the input parameters size.

# **Implementing The First Neural Network With Tensorflow**  
# We will begin with the implementation of a logistic regression model on the datasets to establish a baseline accuracy to be improved upon with the inclusion of one or more hidden layers comprising a true neural network.  
# One thing should be made clear about how we are constructing our input dataset to be learned by our models. Each individual input example that we have extracted from historical tournament data will be a 32-element column vector with the first 16 elements being the regular season per game statistics for the team that won that particular tournament game and 16 elements being the statistics for the losing team. These column vectors will be bound together into a single input matrix.  
# In other words, when we label our input examples every example will be labelled '1' indicating that Team 1 (represented by the first 16 data points) beat Team 2 (represented by the last 16 data points). It will be very easy for any of our models to overfit this lopsided dataset by finding meaningless patterns within the per game statistics that produce high output values (interpreted by the logistic function as near-1 win probability). To prevent overfitting and to influence the model to find patterns between the first 16 team statistics and the last 16 team statistics we will duplicate every example with the positions for Team 1 and Team 2 flipped and label all of those example as '0' indicating that the first team lost that particular matchup. The origianl and generated examples will be shuffled together into the train and test sets.
