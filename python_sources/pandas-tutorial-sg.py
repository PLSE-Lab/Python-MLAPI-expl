# * Pandas is an open source Python library for highly specialized data analysis
# * This library has been designed and developed primarily by Wes McKinney starting in 2008; later, in2012, Sien Chang, one of his colleagues, was added to the development
# * main purpose processing of data, data extraction, and data manipulation
# * The heart of pandas is just the two primary data structures Series and Data Frame

# Assignment create two dataframe one has studendid and marks and another has student id and phone number
# The first dataframe will have values like s1,s2,s3 and 75,78,82 the second dataframe
# will have values like s1,s2,s3 and phone number like 9998764523 etc, Merge them
