# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Apriori algorithm ONLY accepts list of lists. Therefore we need to convert our dataframe into a list of lists called bag.
# In other words, we have a big list of transactions where each transaction contains a list of items in that specific transaction.
# I chose 9466 because thats the maximum number of transactions. We cannot have a list longer than this.

#We need to create the rules that indicate the likelihood of items bought together.
#The 0.0022 support comes from: (3(min number of times an item was purchased in a day) * 7 (converted to a week)) / total transactions
#The higher the confidence, more obvious the rules are. The lower the confidence, less obvious they are. We wanna see the less obvious!
#lift, roughly, greater than 3 means strong likelihood of items being associated. less lift is bad!
#min_length is the min number of associated items we want to see in results. We don't wanna see just Coffee associated to itself!
