# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
