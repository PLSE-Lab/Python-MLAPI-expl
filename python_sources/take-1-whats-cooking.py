# ## The problem at hand is a supervised multiclass classification learning problem. As the data is in text form, we could try few algorithms which are known to work well in such settings
# 
# #### The algorithms to be tried are
# 1. Naive Bayes - Bernoulli
# 2. Naive Bayes - Multinomial
# 3. Random Forest
# 4. SVM - Linear
# 5. SVM - Non Linear (not applied as it takes long time to run and accuracy is not impresseive - codes are available)
# 6. Logistic Regression
