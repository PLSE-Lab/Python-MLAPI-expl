# This notebook is about analysing NBA players regular season stats.  The analysis will lead towards building three different classification models (logistic regression, support vector classifier, and random forest) to predict All-NBA Teams for the 2015-16 and 2016-17 NBA seasons. Team statistics have been ignored in this analysis. Only player stats will be used for the predictions.
# 
# Note: The dataset used for making predictions is not available on Kaggle. This notebook only shows the exploratory data analysis. Python scripts for modelling and prediction can be found on my GitHub repository at https://github.com/wtjw1993/analysing_nba_stats.
