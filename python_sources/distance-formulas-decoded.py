from scipy.spatial import distance
#Generally we have 3 types of distance formulas: euclidan, manhattan, hamming distance. 
#The easiest way to understand the difference is to create functions for them instead of using .euclidean(),  .cityblock()  .hamming()

  distance = 0

def manhattan_distance(pt1, pt2):

#Euc. distance and cityblock (manhattan) distance is very easy and common, but for me humming distance is most interesting
#as you can use it to compare lists, for example of words.
