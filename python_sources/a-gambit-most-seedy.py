# What if, by exceedingly good fortune, we managed to guess the structure of the weight generating code together with the random seed.  (Hey, they said they put this contest together in haste.) Then we'd know the exact weights of all the gifts. And we can test the weights against the known correct leaderboard score for "sample_submission.csv."
# 
# (Okay, so it's a really cheesy gimmick. Actually, I just wanted to experiment with kernels and python, but for some reason, it has to be in public.)
