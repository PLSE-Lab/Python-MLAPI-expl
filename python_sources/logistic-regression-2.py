#In this project we will be working with an advertising data set, 
#indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
#We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# Because we will predict whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement and the target is binary and classified
#Logistic Regression suits better for this data set
#But we need to split data into training set and testing set using train_test_split
