# Some cv split generating code. version 1, so simple(and maybe hidden bug). removed class `hard_tile` later something better should be done.
# 
# Note that if you create n_fold=6(as example), some folds won't have all the classes. using 4fold because all folds have all classes that way. This is simple but likely other ways.
