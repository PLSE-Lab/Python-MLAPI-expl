# as a csv
#  
# For a work experience student's project
#  

# First, we read in the data using the pandas package:

# In[ ]:


# import packages 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np

#get the data
bball = pd.read_csv('../input/ncaa_bball_rankings.csv')

#We have the 9 columns as expected, and 353 rows
print(bball.columns)
print(bball.shape)


# Now, we perform some cleaning (don't worry about how this is working):

# In[ ]:


#change the columns with scores in to be wins - losses and number of games played as separate columns (easier for machine learning)
def split_out_scores(string):
    ## given a string, splits out the values
    ## eg '50-4' gets returned as (54,0.93) as there were 54 games played and overall 93% of games were won 
    wins_losses = string.split('-') #split out into two parts
    wins_losses = list(map(int, wins_losses)) #change from string to integer
    games_played = sum(wins_losses)
    #have to be careful to avoid dividing by zero with win proportion
    if (games_played):
        win_proportion = round(wins_losses[0] / (games_played),2)
    else:
        win_proportion = np.NaN
    return(games_played, win_proportion)
#see it in action
split_out_scores('50-4')

def split_out_scores_column(df, col):
    ## given the pandas df and a column in the df, returns the df with the two new columns
    
    #perform split_out_scores on specified column
    new = pd.DataFrame(bball[col].apply(lambda x: split_out_scores(x)).tolist()) 
    #rename
    new = new.rename(columns = {0: col+'_games_played', 1: col+'_win_proportion'})
    #new = new.rename(columns = {"0": str(col+'_games_played'), "1": str(col+'win_proportion')})
    
    combined = pd.merge(df,new,left_index = True, right_index = True)
    return(combined)

    return(combined)

print(bball.shape)

##apply the splitting on the columns that have it
for col in ['record', 'road', 'neutral', 'home', 'non_div']:
    bball = split_out_scores_column(bball,col)
    
print(bball.shape)
bball.head()


# Now we can start thinking about machine learning: first we need to think which columns will be useful out of the 19?

# In[ ]:
