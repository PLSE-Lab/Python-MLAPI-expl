# In this notebook, I want to show that tiff images are flipped in y-axis. 
# 
# What, I mean is that the index of row 0 correponds to the max latitude and row end 
# to the min latitude

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
