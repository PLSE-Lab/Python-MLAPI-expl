# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import os
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import plotly
import plotly.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
plt.style.use('ggplot')
color_pal = [x['color'] for x in plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle']]

# Format the data
df = pd.read_csv('../input/lanl-leaderboard/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction-publicleaderboard_05_31_2019.csv')
df['SubmissionDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['SubmissionDate'])
df = df.set_index(['TeamName','SubmissionDate'])['Score'].unstack(-1).T
df.columns = [name for name in df.columns]

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
