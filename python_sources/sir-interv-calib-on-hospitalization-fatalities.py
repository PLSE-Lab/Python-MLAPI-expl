# This notebook can be used to calibrate a SEIR-type model on US covid data reported by https://covidtracking.com
# 
# The code calibrates the model parameters to the reported curves of for either fatalities or hospitalized people, or both together.
# 
# The model assumes a 4 day incubation period. Transmission rates, recovery rate, hospitalizationa and death rates are calibrated.
# The model also calibrates the effect and timing of an intervention to reduce the transmission rate; these paratemers are calibrated from the data rather than given as inputs.
# 
# results:
# * not quite debugged yet.
# * not sure there is an improvement on my other notebook
# * sensitive to initial guess; need to do more work to better understand local extrema
# * NY: hospitalized curve is linear while death curve is exponential. this is causing problems.
# * CA: hospitalized curve is still very short and the results do not look credible yet
# * both: calibrated R0 is quite higher than reported in scientific journals. calibrated recovery rate 10 to 14 days, which looks credible.
