# Upon examining the datasets, we noted that the training dataset includes a lot of installation_ids that never took the assessments. Also, we noted that there are some records of Bird Measurers but are coded to event_code 4100, which is not included in the training labels. Therefore, the following steps are performed to align the training dataset to the labeling dataset, which is based on the below info provided by Kaggle:

# "
# The file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. Assessment attempts are captured in event_code 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses event_code 4110. If the attempt was correct, it contains "correct":true.
# "

# In[ ]:


correct_count = raw_labels['num_correct'].sum()
incorrect_count = raw_labels['num_incorrect'].sum()
print(f'According to the count of correct and incorrect attempts within the labels dataset, the number of assessment records within the training set should be {correct_count + incorrect_count}')


# In[ ]:


raw_train1 = raw_train[((raw_train['event_code']==4100) | (raw_train['event_code'] == 4110)) & (raw_train['type'] == 'Assessment')]
raw_train2 = raw_train1[((raw_train1['event_code'] == 4100) & (raw_train1['title'] != 'Bird Measurer (Assessment)')) | (raw_train1['event_code'] == 4110)]
raw_train2.info()


# Now, we are fairly comfortable that the two dataset should be good to join and align. Therefore we join the training dataset with the labeling dataset:
# We noted that in the training dataset, the correct/incorrect result is reflected in the event_data column with "true" or "false" syntax. Therefore we implement an edit check to verify that the correct and incorrect attempts from the training set aligned to the calculation per the labeling dataset:

# In[ ]:


train_correct = raw_train2[raw_train2['event_data'].str.contains("true")].shape[0]
train_incorrect = raw_train2[raw_train2['event_data'].str.contains("false")].shape[0]
print (f'The number of correct attempts in the training set is {train_correct}. The number of correct attempts in the labeling dataset is {correct_count}.')
print (f'The number of correct attempts in the training set is {train_incorrect}. The number of correct attempts in the labeling dataset is {incorrect_count}.')


# Based on the above checks, we noted that we need to exclude the records that has 4100 event_code and bird assessment and remove the insallation ids that never took an assessment. Then we need to bring back all the other activities to the final training dataset. Then join the two tables (train & tarin_labels) to form the final training dataset.

train_labels = raw_labels


# 2. Aggregation of data and features:
# 
# By logic, sufficient practice will increase the chance of successfully passing an assessment. Therefore the game play data before each assessment is crucial to the prediction. As such, we need to aggregate the training and testing datasets so that the added features represent the game play statistics before each assessment attempt. I used the code from Erik Bruin to perform the aggregation.
