#  ## Comparing US and Italy's Death Rates ##
# 
# Confirmed cases is a poor metric to follow, especially given the small sample size of test results available in the US.  Death reports are more accurate in both determining real growth rate and predicting future deaths.  This report will analyize the death rate trends of Italy and US (possibly more in the future) and project deaths given the current 6-day average death rate increase.
