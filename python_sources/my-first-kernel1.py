# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import seaborn as sns

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# As we see from correlation table mostly there is no relation between the variables,or just makes inverse correlation.
# There is no Relation between PetalWidthCm and PetalLengthCm ,
# because correlation coefficient is 0. We can consider strong and weak
# relationships accordingly for correlation coefficient which is more and less than 1.
