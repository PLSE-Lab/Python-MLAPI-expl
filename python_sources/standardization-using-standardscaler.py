# **How Standardization improves prediction with Logistic Regression - 11/09/2016**

# In[ ]:


# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# In[ ]:


#Read in train and test datasets.
train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")


# In[ ]:


#Setup predictor and response variables
y_train=train['type']
index_train=train['id']
train=train.drop(['id','type'],axis=1)
train=pd.get_dummies(train)


# In[ ]:


#Setup train and validation cross validation datasets

from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

X_train,X_validation,Y_train,Y_validation=train_test_split(train,y_train,test_size=0.3,random_state=0)


# In[ ]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

#Logistic Regression without Standardization
lr=LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train,Y_train)
y_validation_pred=lr.predict(X_validation)
print(accuracy_score(y_validation_pred,Y_validation))
#This gives an accuracy score of 0.6875


# In[ ]:


#Standardization
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc=StandardScaler()
X_train_std=sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_validation_std=sc.transform(X_validation)


# In[ ]:


#Logistic Regression on standardized dataset
lr=LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train_std,Y_train)
y_validation_pred=lr.predict(X_validation_std)
print(accuracy_score(y_validation_pred,Y_validation))
#This gives an accuracy score of 0.7767.....


# Redoing the Logistic Regression on an 80/20 split of train and validation gives 0.76 accuracy score on non standardized data with 0.82 accuracy on standardized dataset.
