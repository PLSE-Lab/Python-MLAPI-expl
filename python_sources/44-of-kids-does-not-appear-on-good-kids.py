# # Most wanted gifts?
# ### Introduction
# 
# After some discussion regarding this interesting challange the first line of action of our group is understanding the gifts and trying to distribute the "most hated" presents optimizing overall happiness from bottom to top, since it's easier to distribute the most wanted gifts.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # data visualization
from collections import Counter # advanced counting
from pylab import rcParams # advanced time series visualization


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Loading data as numpy arrays using np.genfromtxt()
child_wishlist = np.genfromtxt('../input/child_wishlist.csv', delimiter=',', dtype='int64')

# Be careful to not misinterpret child_wishlist and gift_goodkids! Read documentation!

# Checking the .shape of child_wishlist, it is 11 since index 0 is kid_id followed by 10 gift_id
print(child_wishlist[1])
print(child_wishlist.shape, '\n')

# Checking the .shape of gift_goodkids, it is 1001 since index 0 is kid_id followed by 1000 gift_id
print(gift_goodkids[0])
print(gift_goodkids.shape)

# Getting a new_wishlist without kid_id
new_wishlist = []

# .plot() the histogram of gift_frequencies

plt.hist(new_wishlist, bins=1000)
plt.title("Distribution of gift frequencies")
plt.xlabel("Gift number")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()


# Histogram above is not useful for visualization but it is clear that there is a set of 'loved gifts'

# Getting 10 loved_gift and the top 10 hated

# Wait a second here, **44% of the children does not appear on the gift_goodkids list**, should we start distributing presents for those in order to maximize the wanted gift happines? 

# In[ ]:


# Total amount of kids that does not appear in gift_goodkids list
