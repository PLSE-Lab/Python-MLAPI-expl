# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
import pandas as pd # pandas for data frames
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind # just the t-test from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import probplot # for a qqplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for a qqplot
import pylab

# read in our data
cereals = pd.read_csv("../input/cereal.csv")
# check out the first few lines
cereals.head(10)
# plot a qqplot to check normality. If the varaible is normally distributed, most of the points 
# should be along the center diagonal.

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
