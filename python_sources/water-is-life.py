#Variable USO2013
#Explanation: this is the type of land use
#	Levels:  
#		Vegetation area				"AVD" 
#		Downtown				"CU"   
#		Parks					"EQ" 
#		Housing low density			"H1"  
#		Housing mid density 			"H2"  
#		Housing high density 			"H3"  
#		Infrastructure				"IN"  
#		High Risk Industry 			"IRA" 
#		Low Risk Industry 			"IRB" 
#		Medium Risk Industry 			"IRM" 
#		Mixed (commerce, housing, industry) 	"MX"  
#		Government Reserve 			"RG" 
#		Reserve Housing Conditioned		"RHC" 
#		Reserve Industry Conditioned 		"RIC"

#Variable TU
#Explanation: Type of user
#	Levels:
#		"COMERCIAL" = Commerce
#		"DOMESTICO BAJA" = Low Income 
#		"DOMESTICO MEDIO" = Median Income
#		"DOMESTICO RESIDENCIAL" = High Income 
#		"ESPECIAL"   = Big consumer of water (not industry, e.g. carwash)
#		"INDUSTRIAL" = Industry
#		"SOCIAL = Social Welfare

#Variable:CU
#Explanation: The diameter of the pipe of the house that is connected to the public grid
#	levels in inches 
#		"0.5"  
#		"0.75" 
#		"1"    
#		"1.5"  
#		"2"    
#		"3"    
#		"4"    
#		"10"  
#Variable: M
#Explanation: type of vendor of the device that measure the consumption in the house
#Variable: UL
#Explanation: cubic meters of consumption in January 2016
#The rest of the variables are labelled in the following manner f.1_XXX_XX. You can ignore the first fourth letters (f.1_) because it is an error
#of the conversion, Im sorry. The first three X referes to the month (ENE means Enero, January in Spanish, Feb means Febrero, February in Spanish and so on).  


# In[ ]:


# Let us analyse a particular section of the dataset
# The most impactful point is Housing in the DOMESTICO MEDIO space

# Since we have embedded time series data, we will have to think of a way to incorporate that

# 1. Identify the increase in number of households
# 2. Collated time series of increase in consumption
