# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#reading the csv using pandas
#in R 'diamonds.csv' is part of the ggplot2 library you would have to import the library and then access the 
#datasets that comes with the library using data()
df = pd.read_csv('../input/diamonds.csv')


# In[ ]:


#initial look at the dataset
#in R you would need to insert the name of the dataset as the first argument of the head() function
df.head()


# In[ ]:


#shape of our dataset
# in R you would insert the name of the dataset as the first argument of the dim() function 
df.shape


# From initial observation of the first 5 rows of our dataset we see that we do not need the first column. In R the first column is Carat. one difference between R and Python is that python uses zero based indexing where the initial element of a sequence is assinged the index zero. 
# 
# (Think of the first unnamed column as the way that indexing works in R)

#removing the first column of the dataset using iloc
#you do not need to do this for the diamonds dataset in R. An easy way to do this in R is to set the column 
#to null
#diamomnds[1] <- NULL
df = df.iloc[:,1:]


# In[ ]:


#The first thing I would like to do is check if there are any 'Null' values in the dataset 
#in R a way to check if there are na values in the columns of our dataset is using this function 
#apply(diamonds, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))
df.isnull().any()

#explore the dataset by seeing how cut and color of a diamond affect the price
# histogram of price counts faceted by color and the cut of the diamond is used to color the histogram bars.
p1 = sns.FacetGrid(data = df, col ='color', col_wrap = 4, hue = 'cut')
(p1.map(plt.hist, 'price')).add_legend();

#to do this in R
#ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds)+
#  geom_histogram(aes(fill = cut))+
#  facet_wrap(diamonds$color)
#I think it is more visually appealing and easier to read the output in R
