# # Introduction
# 
# You've seen how to build a model from scratch to identify handwritten digits.  You'll now build a model to identify different types of clothing.  To make models that train quickly, we'll work with very small (low-resolution) images. 
# 
# As an example, your model will take an images like this and identify it as a shoe:
