# Hi Kagglers ! 
# 
# This is a notebook to test what you can do in a few minutes with h2o's migthy GBM. I also included some basic grid search and early stopping to make the model more competitive. There is no CV in this kernel, I simply used a train/validation split framework. Unfortunately h2o does not allow you to correct for stratification when splitting (to my knowledge), so I rather used sklearn splitting function. 
# 
# A neat feature is that you can keep an eye on the scoring history along the training with scoring_history() function on many metrics of interest, not only AUC ROC.
# 
# Feel free to comment, fork and upvote, happy kaggling, Cheers!

# ## Start h2o and load the data  <a name="step1"></a>
# 
# Start the h2o cluster and load train, validation and test datasets as h2oFrames. 
# 
# Train/Validation split is done with sklearn function, to correct for stratification on the target column.
