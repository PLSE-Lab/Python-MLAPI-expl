# # KMeans Ant Colony Optimization
# 
# This notebook extends my previous work on the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm
# - https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/ant-colony-optimization-algorithm/
# 
# 
# The Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm can be extended using KMeans clustering, to solve for larger map sizes `N=64` to `N=256` which is explored in this Notebook.
# 
# The basic idea is that while Ant Colony Optimization is NP-Hard with a time complexity of `O(N^2)`, the algorithm is fast to solve for small map sizes. 
# - KMeans is used to subdivide the map into small regonalized clusters, which can be quickly solved for small `N`
# - The pheromone trail is persisted between runs, which provides a heuristic for solving large maps
# - The cluster size starts off small and gradually expands
# - Each new iteration presents the simplifies subproblem of how to add a few extra nodes to an existing local map
# - The number of clusters is eventually reduced to 1: the original problem definition
# - With a prebuilt pheromone trail, the ants can usually solve large maps within a small number of round trips

# # Kmeans Ant Colony Solver
# 
# Future Ideas
# - Try doing random resampling once before converging clusters  
# - Try solving for subsets composed of a random member in each clusters
# - Try minimum n_clusters = 4
# - Sum pheromones from neighbouring nodes 
#     - If there is a strong path in a neighbouring nodes, try going directly to it
# - Add in a crowd control heuristic 
#     - keep track of ants currently on each edge
#     - treat this as an anti-pheromone heuristic
#     - might lead to more efficent exploration around best path
# - Use Hill Climbing or Beam Search to detangle corners

# # NP-Hard Scalability
# 
# So lets see how this performs in practice
# - It is about one order of magnitude faster: 
#     - it can solve N=64   (34s) in about the same time it used to solve N=32  (27s)
#     - it can solve N=128 (179s) in about the same time it used to solve N=64 (130s)
