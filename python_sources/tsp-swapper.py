# # Local neighborhood search (swapping) by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem
# 
# In this notebook, I show how we can iteratively improve our solution by taking subsequences and then solving the TSP (using Google OR-Tools) on that subsequence. This already improves a strong greedy solution, but is still not yet optimal due to the fact that I only swap the order of (subsequences of) slides around. I will not look for better pairs of vertical photos to put on a slide.
# 
# You can play around with the hyper-parameters `SUBSEQ_LEN` and `TIME_LIMIT` to get a better score.
# 
# The initial greedy solution was generated in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/group16/greedy-solution-lb-400k).
# 
# **If you like the notebook, or you use it for your submission, please do not forget to upvote it! I do not like to ask for this, but apparently it is needed in this competition... (My previous notebook has more forks than upvotes)**
