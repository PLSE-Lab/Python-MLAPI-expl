# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import pydicom
# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
# for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
#     for filename in filenames:
#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session


# Let's load our train.csv

# In[ ]:


train = pd.read_csv('../input/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/train.csv')

train.head()


# In[ ]:


train_images_dcm_dir = '../input/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/train/'
train_images_jpeg_dir = '../input/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/jpeg/train/'


# In this competetion, we are provided with two versions of same lesion: DICOM and JPEG. DICOM is extemely useful format in medical and it has metadata that further gives more insightful information.

# In[ ]:


dcm = pydicom.dcmread(train_images_dcm_dir + list(train['image_name'])[10] + '.dcm').pixel_array

jpeg = plt.imread(train_images_jpeg_dir + list(train['image_name'])[10] + '.jpg')


# In[ ]:


f,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(10,5))
ax[0].imshow(dcm)
ax[1].imshow(jpeg)

ax[0].set_title('Image from DCM')
ax[1].set_title('JPEG Image')


# We can clearly see the difference color for both images. The appearance of pinkish shade for DCM images is due to color conversion mismatch and it can be corrected as follows:

# In[ ]:


dcm2 = cv2.cvtColor(dcm, cv2.COLOR_YCrCb2BGR)


# In[ ]:


f,ax = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(15,10))
ax[0].imshow(dcm)
ax[1].imshow(dcm2)
ax[2].imshow(jpeg)

ax[0].set_title('Image from DCM')
ax[1].set_title('DCM image after color conversion')
ax[2].set_title('Corresponding JPEG image')
