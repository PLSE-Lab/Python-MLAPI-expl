# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

#How are Gre Scores?
#Firstly,Plotting scatter plot for 'GRE Score' and 'Chance of Admit'
sns.scatterplot(x=admission_data['GRE Score'],y=admission_data['Chance of Admit '])


# In[ ]:


#The above plot suggests that there is GRE scores and Admission chances are positively corelated.Thus we can say that students with high GRE scores are likely
#to have high probability of getting admission.
#To double check the strength of the relationship, We will add a regression line.
sns.regplot(x=admission_data['GRE Score'],y=admission_data['Chance of Admit '])#We get a high slope for this regression line and thus confirms our result.
