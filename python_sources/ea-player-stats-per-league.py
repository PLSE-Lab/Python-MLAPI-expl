# ## EA player stats per league and game frequencies

# We'll look at the distribution of average player ratings per team for each league. The averages are determined using the Player_Stats table in combination with the Match table. We also plot the frequency of games for each league.

# **Getting player stats for each game in the database**
# 

# For each game we'll determine the mean overall_rating statistic for __4 player groups__: 
# 
#  - F=forward (striker), M=midfield, D=defense, G=goalie.
# 
# Doing this task requires us to iterate over the Match table and get the stats for each player on the home and away teams using the Player_Stats table. Multiple rows of statistics exist for each player and we'll select the one whose datestamp most closely aligns with the game date.
# 
# The player position is determined using the player's 'Y' coordinate from the Match table. These coordinates are integers ranging from 1 to 11 (0 and None are assumed to be unknown). Based on the distribution below we'll define positions as follows:
# 
#  - Y=1 -> G
#  - Y=3 -> D   
#  - Y=5-7 -> M   
#  - Y=8-11 -> F
