# This algorithm loops over each family pair and checks if swapping their days could be beneficial. If it is, it does that and puts both families in blacklist to avoid confusion around swapping with these again. Should not be used and is kept more as history because the following modification is much more efficient.

# # This is a modification that favors more expensive swaps and seems to work faster
# ## Also includes a generator to loop over yielded values
# Basically it makes a list of money-effective swaps, orders it by the difference in choice scores, then swaps as many of those as it can (blacklisting swapped families to avoid confusion). It is an iterative algorithm that can improve score each iteration until it is perfect (though late iterations might not yield as much difference). Also it keeps the same amount of families each day which might not be good.
