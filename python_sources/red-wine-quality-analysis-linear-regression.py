# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

# as we can see there is huge difference between 75% percentile and max values for residual sugar, free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur
# dioxide - which means there are some huge outliers in the data

# correlation matrix

# from the heatmap, dark shades represent positive correlation and light shades represent negative correlation
# we can see that "fixed acidity" and "citric acid", "density" and "fixed acidity",

# I will use linear regression model to determine the quality of the wine
# I will use backward elimination method
# Steps are as follows :
# 1. select the signifcance level to stay in the model (eg : SL = 0.05)
# 2. Fit the model to all the possible predictors
# 3. Consider the predictor with highest P-value, if P > SL then go to STEP 4 or else to STEP 6
# 4. Remove the predictor
# 5. Fit the model without this variable and go to step 3
# 6. Finish the model

# let us remove the multicollinear variables from the dataset

# applying backward elimination

# now looking at the P-value column(P>|t|) we have to eliminate the columns whose P-value SL(0.05)
# we have to remove x2 column
X_opt = X[:,[0,2,3,4,5]]
regressor_OLS = sm.OLS(endog = y, exog = X_opt).fit()
regressor_OLS.summary()

# that's it. There is no more predictor with p-value > SL so will stop here 
# and we can see that R-squared and Adj.R-squared are very close to 1
# our model fits well


# In[ ]:


# now rebuilding our training and test dataset and predicting the result
# after backward elimination we found that few predictors to be removed
# so let us bulid a new training and test data set from these observations
