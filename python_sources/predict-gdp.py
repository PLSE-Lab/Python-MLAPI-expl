# # Our Goal
# 
# #### This project's goal is predicting GDP using DL.
# 
# 
# ## Info
# #### In this project you must recognize following contents.
# 1. We will only choose market economy nations.
# 2. Fisrt, We will use GDP per capita. And we will add more indicators one by one.
# 
# 
# ## Used indicators
# 1. GDP per capita
# 
# ## Used countries
# KOR, JPN, IND, IDN, TUR, FRA, DEU, ITA, GBR, RUS, CAN, MEX, USA, ARG, BRA, ZAF, AUS
# 
# # Apendix
# #### Country_code of G20 Members
# 1. Korea KOR
# 2. JAPAN JPN
# 3. India IND
# 4. Indonesia IDN
# 5. Saudi Arabia SAU
# 6. Trukey TUR
# 7. France FRA
# 8. Germany DEU
# 9. Italy ITA
# 10. UK GBR
# 11. Rusian Federation RUS
# 12. Canada CAN
# 13. Mexico MEX
