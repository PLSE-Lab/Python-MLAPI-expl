# ## Libraries

# In[ ]:


# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session


# ## Data

# In[ ]:


df = pd.read_csv('../input/malaria-dataset/reported_numbers.csv')
df.head()


# ## EDA

# In[ ]:


df.groupby(['Year'])['No. of cases'].sum().plot()
plt.title('No. of reported cases over the year')


# In[ ]:


df.groupby(['Year'])['No. of deaths'].sum().plot(c='orange')
plt.title('No. of reported deaths over the year')
