# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# In this instance you would also have record with id 9235 that would have the same amount of rainfall that would have been stored under 
# "RISK_MM" as that feature stores the rainfal for the next day.
