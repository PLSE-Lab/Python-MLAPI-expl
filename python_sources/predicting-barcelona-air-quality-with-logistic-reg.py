# As you can see, the model does very well with unseen data
# When the model predicted the air quality is GOOD, the air quality was infact good 550 times out of 561. 
# When the model predicted the air quality is MODERATE, the air quality was infact moderate 9 times out of 10
# Overall, the model predicts correctly 97.8% of the time

# Naturally, O3, NO3, and PM10 are main components of the Air Quality Index so they should predict the Air Quality quite well
# However, PM2.5, SO2 and CO are also measures that contribute to the Index
# So, 3 of the 5 or 6 components of the index are on their own accurate almost 98% of the time to see if the Air is Moderate or Good
