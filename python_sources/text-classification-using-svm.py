# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split #split data into train and test sets
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer #convert text comment into a numeric vector
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer #use TF IDF transformer to change text vector created by count vectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC# Support Vector Machine
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline #pipeline to implement steps in series
from gensim import parsing # To stem data

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory


#Read csv into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv("../input/Sharktankpitchesdeals.csv")
#print first 5 rows of dataset
print(df.head())

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
