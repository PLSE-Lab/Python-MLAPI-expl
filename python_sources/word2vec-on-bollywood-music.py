# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Prepare a dataset of bollywood songs lyrics and upload the data set
# Data Augmentation: e.g. oo<->u, hh<->h, ei<-> e, aa<->a and many such rules
# Use Gensim to run word2vec on the documents
# Step 3: Analyze interesting cases/prepare some reports
# Step 4: Feed these results into an RNN/LSTM/GAN architecture to generate lyrics
# Step 5: 
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
