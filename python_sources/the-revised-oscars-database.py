# ## A big issue with the database is the inconsistent labelling of different Award categories. After consulting <www.oscars.org> this notebook combines the various related categories to be identified with the label that is in use at present. There are also some other errors, which are corrected.

# #### Disclaimer: I do not claim to have corrected all the errors. And I apologise at the outset if in this process new ones are introduced.
