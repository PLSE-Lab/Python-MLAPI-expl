#Analysis of person with highest salary
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['workex']

df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['specialisation']
#Had specialisation in MKtFin
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['ssc_p']
#Scored only 60 percent score in 10th.
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['hsc_p']
#Scored 68 % in 12 th
#Average of 12 th and 10th was around 63 percent

#Central
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['degree_t']
#degree in communication and management
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['etest_p']
#Score : 82.66 (good score)
df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['degree_p']

df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['hsc_s']
#Commerce
value = df1[df1['salary'] == 940000.0]['mba_p']
#Score was above 64.34
#So we can observe that student was placed with average of 60 percentage in school and only with average scores in degree and mba pass percentage.
#He had good set of skills which seemed appropriate for job.(awarded wth good amount of salary)
#Skill seemed very important to company (Commerce or Science)

#Conclusion
#School Academic details has been essential in shortlisting the students for placements.
      #Requirements:
         #He/she should have scored minimum of 60 percentage either in 10th or 12th so that overall percentage comes above 55 percent.
             #Students who were not placed,many of them did not satisfy thid basic criteria.
         #Preferrable for students to have background in Commerce(Company offered good amount of salary).
         #Science stream is also preffered ,but salary awarded was less as compared to Commerce stream students.
#UG details:
     #Requirements:
        #He/she should have good etest_scorei(increase in salary accordingly),even if degree pass percetage is very low.
        #Prefferable to have degree in communication and management.
        #Degree percentage is not considered as important factor,as a student with less degree has also got placed with good amount of salary.
#Mba details:
     #Requirements:
       #Prefferable to have degree in marketing and finance.
