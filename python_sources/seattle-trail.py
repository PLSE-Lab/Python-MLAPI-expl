# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import csv

with open("../input/Trails.csv") as trails:
    reader = csv.reader(trails)
    next(reader) # skip header
    data = [r for r in reader]
    print(data) 
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
#print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
