# Here we will try to build a neural network that predicts 
# The price of a house according to a simple formula.

# So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, 
# So that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.

# How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship 
# so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.

# Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. 
# You don't have to give the answer 400...
# It might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, 
# and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc.
