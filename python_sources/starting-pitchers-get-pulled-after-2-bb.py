#How many walks does it take for a starting pitcher to get pulled?
#Starting pitchers tend to get pulled after 2 Walks.

#To do a more in depth study we would need a database of all games played with results and the 
#information of the pitcher, so this analysis only scratches the surface of this very interesting
#question.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
