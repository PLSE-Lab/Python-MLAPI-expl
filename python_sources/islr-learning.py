# ## Let's play with some data.
# Kaggle lets you easily import data, and someone already uploaded everything from the book to make it super ezpz
# ### So we don't run into too many issues, lets just each take a cell and keep our work in it
#  - A cell is basically a self contained bit of code
#  - Make sure to hit Commit in the top right o save your work

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
import seaborn as sb
sb.set()

###Garrett
###I'm just here so I don't get fined

###Calculate the acceptance rate and add it to the data frame
rate=College['Accept']/College['Apps']
College['A-Rate']=rate

###Make sure all Private answers are exactly yes and no
if np.all(np.logical_or(College['Private']=='Yes', College['Private']=='No')):
    print('We good!')
else:
    print('Noooooooo')

###I feel like there is probably a much better way to go about doing this, but it's what I know at the moment
priv_ind=np.where(College['Private']=='Yes')[0]
print(priv_ind[:20])
pub_ind=np.where(College['Private']=='No')[0]

sb.distplot(College['A-Rate'][pub_ind], label='Public')
