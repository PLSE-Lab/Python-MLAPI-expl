# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# In[ ]:


# load the dataset and understand the data
heart_df = pd.read_csv(r'../input/heart.csv')
heart_df.head()


# In[ ]:


# pandas describe function helps you to understand statistical properties of the dataset
heart_df.describe()

# look on mean, max, min and find out outliers etc. it gives a quick glance but
# but misses many properties - NAN, missing values etc


# In[ ]:


# Info function helps in knowing the total values, nan etc,
heart_df.info()


# In[ ]:


# you can use pandas profiling for robust and more details analyiss of the data
# you need to install pandas-profiling using pip 
# import the pandas_profiling 
# to make report you can use ProfileReport
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport
ProfileReport(heart_df)

# it gives whole report of your dataset
# and very useful for first analysis


# In[ ]:


# you can save this work by as an image / html page 


# Comment your view about pandas profiling.
