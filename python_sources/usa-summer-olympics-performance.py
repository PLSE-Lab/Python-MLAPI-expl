# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting library

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Group data by Year and Country
gd = pd.DataFrame({"tally" : df.groupby(["Year", "Country"]).size()}).reset_index()
df1 = gd.loc[gd["Country"] == "USA"]

# Make year as index
usa_tally = df1.set_index("Year")
ax = usa_tally[["tally"]].plot(kind="bar", title="USA Summer Olympics Performance 1896-2012", figsize=(15, 10))
ax.set_xlabel("Year", fontsize=12)
