# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# according to wiki boomers were born between 1946 and 1964 - since this dataset is between 1985 and 2016 estimate critical suicide group age
# is between 21 and 72 - basically adult male - it's interesting that the suicide no for females has a completely different structure
