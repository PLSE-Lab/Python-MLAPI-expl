# the goal is to take an image with a black background and make it transparent
# that way we can overlay it on other images
# for some reason i can't find a convenient library for this
# maybe it's too simple? wasn't for me...
# TL;DR see `def black_to_transparent` at the end if you just want to copy/paste

# first let's illustrate the problem:


# In[ ]:


# start with RGB uint8 array
foreground_img = np.array([
            [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]],
            [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1]],
            [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1]],
            [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]],
        ]) * 255 # (the uint8 part, all the 1s needs to be 255)
print(foreground_img.shape) # note the shape (height, width, depth)
plt.imshow(foreground_img)


# In[ ]:


# note that the shape is 4,5,3
# the black is ugly, let's replace it with a soothing blue

# make soothing background color
background_img = (np.ones(foreground_img.shape)*[0,0.3,0.3] * 255).astype(np.uint8)
plt.imshow(background_img)


# In[ ]:


# now let's overlay
fig = plt.figure()
bg = fig.add_subplot(111)
bg.imshow(background_img)
fg = fig.add_subplot(111)
fg.imshow(foreground_img)
plt.show(fig)


# In[ ]:


# seems like we lost our background, but if there was alpha on the foreground we'd see it
fig = plt.figure()
bg = fig.add_subplot(111)
bg.imshow(background_img)
fg = fig.add_subplot(111)
fg.imshow(foreground_img, alpha=0.5)
plt.show(fig)


# In[ ]:


# so how do we add an alpha channel and make all of our blacks transparent?

# first make the alpha channel:
alpha_channel = (np.ones(foreground_img.shape[0:2]) * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# then we can use dstack to append it to the 3rd dimension of the foreground_img
alpha_img = np.dstack((foreground_img, alpha_channel ))
print(alpha_img.shape)

# now our image with alpha has one more dimension for alpha but it should plot the same as the foreground image
plt.imshow(alpha_img, alpha=0.5) # alpha to show the white background behind it


# In[ ]:


# if we put 0s in the areas of the image without color in them, we'll be able to see the background
# so first an experiment to make sure we know how to set the alpha channel from alpha_img
# let's try cutting the 255 alpha's down a bit and make sure it plots correctly
alpha_img[:,:,foreground_img.shape[2]] = 180
alpha_img
plt.imshow(alpha_img)


# In[ ]:


# so now instead of a fixed 180, we need it to be 255 when one of the other channels is non-zero or 0 if all channels are zero
# alpha_img[:, :, 0:3] gets us the RGB without the A, so if we sum up the whole image by the RGB axis
# and clip it to valid rgb values, we've got our mask
mask = np.sum(alpha_img[:, :, 0:foreground_img.shape[2]], axis=2).clip(0,255)
print(mask.shape)
mask


# In[ ]:


# now let's set our alpha channel on foreground_img that we made above to the mask
alpha_img[:,:,foreground_img.shape[2]] = mask

# and overlay
fig = plt.figure()
bg = fig.add_subplot(111)
bg.imshow(background_img, alpha=1.0)
fg = fig.add_subplot(111)
fg.imshow(alpha_img)
plt.show(fig)


# In[ ]:


# copy and paste here :D
# let's distill this down into a reusable function
# this turns a (uint8) image into (uint8 + alpha channel) image where black pixels are alpha=0
def black_to_transparent(img):
    num_channels = img.shape[2]
    dimensions = img.shape[0:2]
    alpha_channel = (np.ones(dimensions) * 255).astype(np.uint8)
    alpha_img = np.dstack((img, alpha_channel ))
    mask = np.sum(alpha_img[:, :, 0:img.shape[2]], axis=2).clip(0,255)
    alpha_img[:,:,num_channels] = mask
    return alpha_img


# In[ ]:


# done :D
fig = plt.figure()
bg = fig.add_subplot(111)
bg.imshow(background_img)
fg = fig.add_subplot(111)
fg.imshow(black_to_transparent(foreground_img))
