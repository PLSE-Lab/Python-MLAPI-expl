# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression #
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import style
style.use('ggplot')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
#Simple Linear regression works whatever the features we feed through it
