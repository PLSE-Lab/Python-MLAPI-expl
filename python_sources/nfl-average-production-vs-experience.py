# # Average Production vs. Experience for NFL Players

# For this project, I wanted to look at how productive NFL players were versus the number of seasons they had played by position. For example, my assumption going in was that RBs were more productive earlier in their career whereas it took QBs a little longer to develop. The dataset I used had all of a players stats for each season they played. Data is up to and includes 2016 season. My methodology was to create dataframes for each player, calculate how "productive" a player was in each season, then normalize all the player's stats for their career. That way, I had a normalized list of how "productive" a player was for every season in their career. After that, I will average each players' productivies with all the other players of the same position to get an average productivity versus experience list.
