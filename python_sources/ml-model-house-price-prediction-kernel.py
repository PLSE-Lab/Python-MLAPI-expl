# Concepts of Overfitting, Underfitting and Model optimization
# Overfitting : In case Tree based model, when the depth of tree is too much high, the leafs would be high and thus model matches trainign data accurately.
# This catches patterns which wont be of specific use in general. Thus performs bad on testing data
# UnderFitting : Tree depth is shallow and we spilt data in very few patterns example 2-4 leaves. Thus we would fail in capturing important patterns.
# Balance has to be in capturing optimal middle ware between which performs well.

# Lets dive into some other model to look into the performance
# Decision tree leaves you with a complex decsion of max_leaves to perform optimally
# Too many leaves tend to cause overfitting and thus perform bad on testing data
# Few leaves cause underfitting and thus loose out crucial patterns
# RandomForest is the model which uses may trees,  and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. This may be better than a single deciosn tree
