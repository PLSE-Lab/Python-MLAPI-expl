# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

# TODO: Use average review scores to further hone results.
# TODO: Add genres to the output CSV
# TODO: Filter out all hentai - we won't watch them.
# TODO: Filter out all music videos - we won't watch them.
# TODO: Add episode count to output file. 13 episode long series fit better into a single semester of viewing.
# TODO: Distinguish between shorts and full-length episodes. Shorts have a much lower average audience score on MAL, but we're willing to spend 1-2 minutes watching something with a relatively low score.
