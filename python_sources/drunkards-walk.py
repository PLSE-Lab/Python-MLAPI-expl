#  **Markov Chain Generated Wine Review**
#  
# Another name for a Markov process (although somewhat outdated) is the *drunkards walk*. Markov chains are a remarkably simple yet powerful tool that can be applied in a wide range of contexts, such as dertermining the importance of webpages, chemical kinetics, and text generation. A Markov process can be considered a random walk, where each step is independent of the previous one. More formally, it is a stochastic process in which state changes are probabilistic and which future states depend on the current state only. 
# 
# Here, a simple Markov chain is constructed from the set of wine reviews to generate your own wine review; simply provide country and variety.  Included is a function to filter the full set of wine reviews to be  specific to a given country and variety - also correcting any mispelling - and filtering out wines with too few reviews.  The data set is not explored as there are plenty other excellent kernels that do that for this data set.
# 
# One possible use for this function is to make yourself sound more fancy when commenting on wine. Perfect for use on a date, formal dinner, or even wine tasting.
# 
# Edit: Replaced nltk edit distance with fuzzywuzzy for improved accuracy of spell-checking.

# Function `randomStep' constructs the dictionary `steps'.

# each occurance of a key, e.g., the sequence 'the wine is' provides the key 'the'
# with value 'is', and key 'wine' with value 'is'. Keys may contain multiple identical
# values; this reflects the probability of selecting a ertain value given a key.
# This is the anture of a Markov chain: the probability of transitioning from one state
# to another. Here, the probability of transitioning from one word to another stems
# from the relative frequency of that bi-gram.
