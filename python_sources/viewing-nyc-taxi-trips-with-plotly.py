# **Introduction **
# <br>Here is a Python notebook that illustrates colorful and interactive visuals for NYC Taxi Trips data using Plotly. My objective was to explore the  trip records and find interesting insights about passenger movement using an interactive tool. I learnt a lot while experimenting with Plotly and I hope you like this beginner script. My go to source was Plotly website.
# 
# The kernels shared in this competition have been an extremely useful and inspiring source of learning.
# I learnt a lot (technically and creatively) from the following and refer them all the time. Thankyou for sharing.
#     1. Beluga's Kernel, 
#     2. BuryBury Moon's implementation of folium maps
#     3. Chris Cross - Basic Network Analysis notebook  
#     
# Lets, put on our thinking caps and dive into the millions of taxi trip records to glean interesting patterns.<br>
# **As a passenger what factors can impact our commute time ?**<br>
# Here are some common ones - traffic, location, weekday and hour, speed of the drive, external events - accidents/rallies leading to closed roads/ long weekends and weather.
#  So, lets pivot the trips on some of the above factors - traffic ( number of trips ), timing ,  speed and location and see what we find with Plotly.

# Lets explore some inquistive questions <br>**Q. How long did the trips last?**<br>

scatter_data = train[train.trip_duration > 3600]  #get trips for more than an hour to avoid plotting bigdata.

#Plot and embed in ipython notebook!
py.iplot(scatdata2, filename='tripduration-scatter')


# **Takeaway**
# * Clearly, we see four outlier trips with more than 500 hours of trip duration.
# * Each of them have an early pickup hour or late night pickup hour.
# * Select and Zoom in on the lower dots, you will notice that there is a certain pattern to the trips' duration. Trips that started at midnight or early morning hours, usually lasted close to a day or less than
# * five hours. There are no trips with duration between 6 to 22 hours in early hours.[Click on the Home icon on top right to reset the axes]

# **Q. What insights do we get from the distribution of trip duration per hour ?**<br> Let's do a box plot to view this.

# In[ ]:


#h0 = train.loc[train['pickup_hour'] == 0, 'trip_duration']
#Remove the four outlier durations
subset1 = train.loc[train['trip_duration'] < 250000]
#Lets convert trip duration to minutes.
subset1['trip_duration_mins'] = subset1['trip_duration']/60

# Trips that lasted between 200 and 1200 minutes have a somewhat linear pattern across pickup hour.

# **Takeaways:**
# As expected, the line trends for weekends is obvious. Since people tend to be outside on weekends and need pickups after late night parties/etc. Same is true for the noticeable drop in taxi demands in early hours on weekends.
# Evenings around 4pm see a drop in demand for all weekdays.

# **City Rides**
# <br> Using networkx , here is a plot showing number of trips between the nearest cities(based on pickup and dropoff geo coordinates. The cities are plotted assuming random graph coordinates. Each node represents a city and an edge between any node represents if any tirp was made between the two cities. Hover over the nodes to see the city name and number of trips for it. A standalone node may have non zero trips indicating that the trips were made within the same city.

# **Takeaway**
# The city connections viz above is based on a sample of 50000 records in january month. So, we can't generalize any fact accurately. But we certainly get the idea about the unique routes passengers take from different cities. Majority of the cities have a very low connection count, suggesting that the trips were mostly on repetitive routes . Insights from such graphs may be useful in optimizing ground level taxi operations.

# **Q. How does the trip demand vary by city?**
# <br> For this lets explore the three most common cities New York City, Long Island and Manhattan.
