# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#Can Probably ease the memory requirement and speed up processing by formatting datatypes properly.

# bakery_data['Time']=pd.to_datetime(bakery_data['Time'])

#Types are Proper.Can move Forward.Object dtype is string.

#Frequency Distribution of Items.

bakery_data['Item'].unique()

len(bakery_data['Item'].unique())

#95 Unique Items.Must me a big bakery.

bakery_data['Item'].value_counts()

# Most Popular Ordered item is Coffee which is no surprise.I am surprised though that hot chocolate is 
# ordered very less though

# Mandatory Nan Check

bakery_data.isnull().sum()

# No empty values found so dataset is clean and processed properly.

# Finding Baskets based on transaction Numbers

baskets=bakery_data.groupby(["Transaction","Date Time","Item"]).groups

# So we have around 19640 Baskets.Let's See if we can find out exactly what these baskets comprise of.

baskets


# Edit:Can anybody confirm whether the above code is the correct way to get the no of items bought together based on transactions id's and the time on whch they were bought.I plan to use this to check for most ordered basket,finding out if some baskets were popular during some specific time periods or months etc.
