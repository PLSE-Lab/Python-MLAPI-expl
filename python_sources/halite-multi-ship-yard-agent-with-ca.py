# # Halite: Multi-Ship & Shipyard Agent with Collision Avoidance
# 
# This is my first time to participate in Halite. I started from a simple greedy heuristic and extended it to handle multiple ships and shipyards, making it a lot more effective. The agent also tries to avoid collisions with other ships and has a few other tricks. This is the main idea:
# 
# * Spawn new ships up to a configured maximum number of ships. 
# * Let each ship collect halite greedily by choosing its own destination that's free and different from the other ships' destinations. 
# * Once a ship reaches a configured halite load, it returns to the closest shipyard to drop off the collected hailte. 
# * If the next shipyard is too far (configurable), the ship converts to a new shipyard (if there's enough halite). This helps avoid losing too much halite during movement.
# * Avoid collisions with own ships and do not move into enemy ships or shipyards.
# * A few other, smaller tricks (see the code)
# 
# This is by no means perfect and there is still a lot of room for improvement, but I believe it's a good starting point for more advanced agents. 
# 
# **If you like the notebook, I'd appreciate an upvote!**

# ## Auxiliary Code
# 
# I created several auxiliary classes to keep the implementation cleaner and easier to extend.
# 
# ### The Halite Board

# To be used as static class without instantiation.
