# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.svm import SVC
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Basic Statistics Summary
# describe()- will returns the quick stats such as count, mean, std (standard deviation), 
# min, first quartile, median, third quartile, max on each column of the dataframe
data.describe()

# cov() - Covariance indicates how two variables are related. A positive covariance means 
# the variables are positively related, while a negative covariance means the variables are inversely related. 
# Drawback of covariance is that it does not tell you the degree of positive or negative relation
data.cov()


# In[ ]:


# corr() - Correlation is another way to determine how two variables are related. 
# In addition to telling you whether variables are positively or inversely related, correlation also 
# tells you the degree to which the variables tend to move together. When you say that two items correlate, 
# you are saying that the change in one item effects a change in another item. You will always talk about correlation 
# as a range between -1 and 1.
data.corr()
