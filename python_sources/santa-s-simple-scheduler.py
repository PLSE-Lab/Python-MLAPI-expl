# ## Santa 2019 Simple Scheduler
# 
# This notebook takes some "simple" approaches to the 2019 Santa problem. <br>
# These are all heuristic algorithms to assign days to the families; <br>
# they only evaluate the Total Cost once after scheduling is complete;<br>
# some parameters of the scheduling are tuned, however.<br>
# 
# ### Why do this?
# 
# Santa's Data Elves pointed out to Santa that they are getting optimized costs less than $ 100,000, <br>
# which is a lot less than the millions of dollars a random schedule would cost. <br>
# So they feel they should share in these considerable savings. <br>
# Santa agrees, but thinks they are overstating the savings of their extreme optimizations. <br>
# So here several of  Ms Claus' previous, simpler algorithms are used <br>
# to see how much more the Data Elves efforts are really saving Santa.  ;-)
# 
# 
# ### Diary
# Setup basic framework and implemented "Random" scheduling.<br>
# (v1) **15,246,819** Random assignment (value will vary with random seed)<br>
# Implemented first-come-first-serve with a limit on the people-per-day, gave 1,082,000 with very low accounting costs.<br>
# Get lower total costs by slightly increasing the people-per-day limit (by 1.5\*ich, e.g. up to 15 higher) when larger choices are being assigned.<br>
# (v2) **756,432** First-come-first-serve with slight people-per-day limit adjust. <br>
# Do the FCFS but in the order from largest to smallest family sizes - this didn't really help. Continue to do FCFS in 0-4999 order, but set a different people limit above day 59 to reduce the large accounting cost at the transition. The 6 under-subscribed day-ranges are very clear in the plot(s) and the lower limit (125) is requiring people get put into those days even though they are not a remaining choice. <br>
# (v3) **570,746** FCFS with split people-limit above day 59. <br>
# Made a matrix output to view the cost-per-person depending on the choice and the number of people: often a higher choice with more people is preferred to the lower choice. With this in mind do the scheduling in order of cost-per-person, first filling the low-request gaps and then the rest and finally putting whatever is left where it will go. Yup, kind of a mess ;-)<br>
# (v4) **132,621** Lowest to highest cost-per-person, fill low regions first. <br>
# Let's include the nice stacked plot from https://www.kaggle.com/ghostskipper/visualising-results <br>
# Fill the "transition" days of the low-demand regions to a higher level than the middle 2 of the 4 days: this reduces the accounting cost; do this for above 55 and below 51 separately. Restrict to only using choices with no more than 78 for the cost-per-person (e.g, up to choice 7 for a family of 7). Finally, if there are some families left over (9 here) give them their 2nd choice.<br>
# (v5) **97,732** Ms Claus' usual algorithm developed over the years ;-) <br>
# Try implementing a Gift Shop Profit (GSP) term which is larger when `family_id`s are clustered, see the back story among posts in the discussion [the optimal solution has been found, right?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/discussion/120211)  The profit term is larger when `family_id`s are closer together, going as $1/(\Delta id^3+8)$ .<br>
# (v6) **97,143** As in v5, but restricted choices to 4 or less. Gift Shop Profits are 2,468.<br>
# Separate the big cell of code into its sections, easier to see what's going on? (A lot of retetition,
# could define a routine to clean it up.)<br>
# Try to increase the GSP by identifying buddy families: ones that share the same day in their low choices AND that are close-together in their `family_id` values. Was hoping to see that assigning buddies to the same day would i) increase the GSP ii) without messing up the costs too much. Hard to increase GSP over what I have without more severely affecting the costs. Did change the calculation of GSP to go as $126/(\Delta id^3+125)$ to make it more relevant. Enough messing around with this for now ;-)<br>
# (v7) **96,934** Same as v6, with some attempt to assign "buddy" family ids to the same day to increase GSP.

# ## Gift Shop Profit
# 
# The following defines and calculates a Gift Shop Profit (GSP) term; for its motivation look among the posts in the discussion topic: [the optimal solution has been found, right?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/discussion/120211)  
# 
# In short, an additional term, the GSP, is proposed to be included in the optimization. The GSP *reduces* the cost to Santa.

# ### Look at how the GSP metric depends on the separation of family id values
# 
# The GSP is based on a metric that measures the closeness of `family_id` s within each day, it is large when families have ids within 5 or less of each other.

# In[ ]:


# The GSP metric function and the gsp_profit_factor were defined at the beginning of this file.

# Hmmm... A very slight effect on the gift shop profit
# which does not quite balance the increase in the Families cost. 
# The decrease in Accounting cost (why?) saves the day.

# It's possible that since I'm going through the families in family order,
# that I've already built-in a reasonable amount of buddying up.
