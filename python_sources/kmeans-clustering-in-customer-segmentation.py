# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

#import the libraries
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #Data Visualization 
import seaborn as sns  #Python library for Vidualization


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# In[ ]:


#Import the dataset

dataset = pd.read_csv('../input/Mall_Customers.csv')

#Exploratory Data Analysis
#As this is unsupervised learning so Label (Output Column) is unknown

dataset.head(10) #Printing first 10 rows of the dataset


# In[ ]:


#total rows and colums in the dataset
dataset.shape


# In[ ]:


dataset.info() # there are no missing values as all the columns has 200 entries properly


# In[ ]:


#Missing values computation
dataset.isnull().sum()


# In[ ]:


### Feature sleection for the model
#Considering only 2 features (Annual income and Spending Score) and no Label available
X= dataset.iloc[:, [3,4]].values


# In[ ]:


#Building the Model
#KMeans Algorithm to decide the optimum cluster number , KMeans++ using Elbow Mmethod
#to figure out K for KMeans, I will use ELBOW Method on KMEANS++ Calculation
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
wcss=[]

#we always assume the max number of cluster would be 10
#you can judge the number of clusters by doing averaging
###Static code to get max no of clusters

for i in range(1,11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters= i, init='k-means++', random_state=0)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

    #inertia_ is the formula used to segregate the data points into clusters

#Visualizing the ELBOW method to get the optimal value of K 
plt.plot(range(1,11), wcss)
plt.title('The Elbow Method')
plt.xlabel('no of clusters')
plt.ylabel('wcss')
plt.show()


# In[ ]:


#If you zoom out this curve then you will see that last elbow comes at k=5
#no matter what range we select ex- (1,21) also i will see the same behaviour but if we chose higher range it is little difficult to visualize the ELBOW
#that is why we usually prefer range (1,11)
##Finally we got that k=5

#Model Build
kmeansmodel = KMeans(n_clusters= 5, init='k-means++', random_state=0)
y_kmeans= kmeansmodel.fit_predict(X)

#For unsupervised learning we use "fit_predict()" wherein for supervised learning we use "fit_tranform()"
#y_kmeans is the final model . Now how and where we will deploy this model in production is depends on what tool we are using.
#This use case is very common and it is used in BFS industry(credit card) and retail for customer segmenattion.

###Model Interpretation 
#Cluster 1 (Red Color) -> earning high but spending less
#cluster 2 (Blue Colr) -> average in terms of earning and spending 
#cluster 3 (Green Color) -> earning high and also spending high [TARGET SET]
#cluster 4 (cyan Color) -> earning less but spending more
#Cluster 5 (magenta Color) -> Earning less , spending less


######We can put Cluster 3 into some alerting system where email can be send to them on daily basis as these re easy to converse ######
#wherein others we can set like once in a week or once in a month

# Thank you and please upvote for the motivation
