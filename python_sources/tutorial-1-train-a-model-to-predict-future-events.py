# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# # Purpose
# 
# The purpose of this kernel is to show a simple example of how to train a model using the matches that have already occured (ufc-master.csv) and use that model to predict future matches (upcoming-event.csv)

# # Load and Prepare the Data

# In[ ]:


#Load the matches that have already occurred 
df = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/ultimate-ufc-dataset/ufc-master.csv")

#Load the upcoming matches

#Make sure the date column is datetime
df_combined['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])


# # Make the dataframes that we are going to need going forward
# 
# We need a training set and a test set for the features and the labels
