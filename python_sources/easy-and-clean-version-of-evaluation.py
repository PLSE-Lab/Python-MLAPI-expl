# This notebook shows numpy version of calculating map in this competition
# 
# I have taken one example from https://www.kaggle.com/pestipeti/competition-metric-details-script and it seems that my code have same result with this code.
# 
# Couple things you need to do before run the function : 
# 
# (1) The boxes should be sorted by their score 
# 
# (2) Convert the format of boxes to (xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax)
# 
# (3) Make sure your gt boxes were not transformed by your Dataset,I spent a while debugging the code and realizing my gt boxes were transformed(Resize and ToTensor)....
# 
# I put some explanation to help you understand my algorithm.I did not test otehr cases except the one I mentioned above.

# This is my first share notebook,If you enjoy reading and find this notebook helpful,that would make my day!
# 
# I write the code on my own,maybe there's something wrong in my code,
# Please correct me if you find any mistake!Thanks!
