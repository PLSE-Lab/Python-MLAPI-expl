#Find the trend in musicians' albums scores over time (e.g. average first score, second score, third score,etc...). See if this 
#trend differs with the number of albums Pitchfork reviews. For example, artists who have only had one album reviewed by Pitchfork
#may have received lower scores on their first album than artists who had multiple albums reviewed by Pitchfork. I'm also curious
#if the scores of a given artist's albums decrease with time. Being hipsters (like me!), maybe Pitchfork gets bored of a particular
#artist/sound with time.

Additional ideas:

-Perform wordclouds for reviews associated with different genres (are certain words unique to rap reviews or electronic reviews), different years, and/or different scores
-Predict scores by review contents
