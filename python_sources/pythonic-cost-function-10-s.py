# This notebook contains my efforts towards understanding this optimization problem but also towards creating a fast neighbourhood definition for local search. I started working on this notebook when the competition began but I'm sharing it now because I haven't managed to get a good solution yet and I thought it was better to share in case anyone else finds it useful.
