# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import urllib, json

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Circle, Wedge, Polygon
from matplotlib.collections import PatchCollection

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
import os
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# This is just a lazy way to make a crude map.
