# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

# So for each restaurant i calculated the approximate cost of eating for one person ,Then i grouped the restaurants by their respective Locations,
# Then finally i got the Approximate Cost to eat per person for a particular location 

#  **The Locations with the highest Approximate Cost per Person**
