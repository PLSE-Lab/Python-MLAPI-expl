# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# **Reading Data**
# 
# In this part, you read data from csv files and create dataframes for each.

# In this part you try to answer the questions. Questions are categorized in 3 group up to their difficulties. If you don't want to get bored at the beginning, you can pass to medium category.

# **Easy Questions**

# question: Good versus Evil - Which group has more combined power?
# difficulty: easy

# In[ ]:


# e-02
# question:   Which alignment (good\bad) has higher avg speed?
# difficulty: easy
# datasets: charcters_stats

##Create a filter to find only good and bad ones
filterGoodAndBad=charcters_stats['Alignment'].isin(['good','bad'])

##Calculate average speed and find the fastest group.
SpeedChampionGroup=charcters_stats[filterGoodAndBad].groupby(by='Alignment').mean()['Speed'].idxmax()
print('Average speed is higher in {} ones'.format(SpeedChampionGroup))


# In[ ]:


# e-03
# question: How many superheros have more Intelligence then strength?
# difficulty: easy
# datasets: charcters_stats

## Create a filter to find the smarter heroes.
SmarterHeroesFilter=charcters_stats['Intelligence']>charcters_stats['Strength']
SmarterHeroes=charcters_stats[SmarterHeroesFilter]['Name']
print('There are {} heroes have more Intelligence then strength'.format(SmarterHeroes.size))

SmarterHeroes.head()


# In[ ]:


# e-04
# question: Show the distribution of Total (all the powers combined) for the good and the evil.
# difficulty: easy
# datasets: charcters_stats

#Creating two filters to find good and bad characters.
filterGood=charcters_stats['Alignment'].isin(['good'])

#Creating a figure for 2 plots

# e-05
# question: How many comics with 7 or more character published each year? (show on graph)
# difficulty: easy

## Creating a filter to find the comics with least 8 characters in 
comicsWith7orMoreCharacterFilter=charactersToComics.groupby(by='comicID').count()['characterID']>7
## Applying the filter and find comics with 7+ characters in it
comicsWith7orMoreCharacterData=charactersToComics.groupby(by='comicID').count()[comicsWith7orMoreCharacterFilter]

##Finding year of the comics
### First, creating a function to extract the year from comics title column
def extractYear(txt):
    startChr=txt.find('(')+1
    endChr=txt.find(')')
    try:
        result=int(txt[startChr:endChr])
        return result
    except:
        pass
    
###Creating a copy of comics data frame
comicsWyear=comics.copy()

###applying extractYear function and creating a new column that contains year of the comics
comicsWyear['year']=comics['title'].apply(extractYear)

### creating a bar chart
comicsWyear.groupby(by='year').count()['comicID'].plot(kind='bar',figsize=(18,12));

del comicsWyear
