#Summary about the Fashion MNIST Dataset:
    
#Each row is a separate image with 785 columns.
#Column 1 is the class label.
#Remaining 784 columns are pixel numbers (As each image is of 28*28 in pixel size).
#Each value is the darkness of the pixel raning from (1 to 255)

#Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
#T-shirt/top as 0,Trouser as 1,Pullover as 2,Dress as 3,Coat as 4,Sandal as 5,Shirt as 6,Sneaker as 7,Bag as 8,Ankle boot as 9"""
