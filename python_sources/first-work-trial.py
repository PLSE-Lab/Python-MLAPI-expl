# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sbor # for visualization 

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# light creme ones (apart from the white-ish diagonal relations) are the
#                               positive correlations (mutual relations)


# High correlations mean **inter-dependency** of variables/features. I guess, as an example, 'Seasons in league' and 'Age' may have somehow a linear inter-dependency by which (after a proper statistical evaluation) we may be excluding one of them from the further investigation.
