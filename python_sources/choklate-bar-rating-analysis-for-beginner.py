# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))


# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# In[ ]:


#load the csv file using pd.read_csv method and save into a variable flavors that is also called a dataframe
flavors  = pd.read_csv("../input/flavors_of_cacao.csv")

''' for printing  the begining five and as we want then we use dataframe.head()
or for last lines use tail() method'''
flavors.head()


# In[ ]:


#to know columns names
flavors.columns


# In[ ]:


# use info method to know about null entries 
flavors.info()
#here we find two columns which have null entries


# In[ ]:


#to know how much column entries have columns 
flavors['Bean\nType'].isnull().sum()
#this colummn has only one null entry
#now check for other column'''


# In[ ]:


flavors['Broad Bean\nOrigin'].isnull().sum()


# In[ ]:


#fill up null entries by fillna function
flavors.fillna(method='bfill',inplace=True)
# use method to fill null entries by backward propogation and inplace =True is  used to modify the result permanent


# In[ ]:


# again check for null entries have or  not
flavors.isnull().sum()
#wow! no any columns have any null entries so we  move on next steps

#print the row which have maximum rating

#two rows printed which have maximum rating 5.0
# conclusion - only company Amedei make the choklate which are so much popular and 
#and the choklate have 70% Cocoa percent
