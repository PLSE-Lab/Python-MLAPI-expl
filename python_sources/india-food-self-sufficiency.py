# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

#from subprocess import check_output
#print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#Read Datasets
country = pd.read_csv('../input/Country.csv')
country_notes = pd.read_csv('../input/CountryNotes.csv')
indicators = pd.read_csv('../input/Indicators.csv')

plt.title('Trends in Food Import/Export in India', fontsize=14)


# As population of India increased, food production does not increase proportionately.
# Hence imports of food as a proportion of total merchandise imports increased.
# With the advent of Green Revolution the output in the country increased. 
# The reason for sharp increase after 1970 would have to be searched for.
# But since then imports have continuously decreased.
# Another thing observed was Exports are always higher than imports.
