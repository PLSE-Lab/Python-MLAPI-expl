# More practice with plotting. Nothing too special, yet.  I may try predicting brew style/origin based on alcohol content at some point.

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

# ## Takeaways ##
# 
#  1. Colorado has by far the most breweries in the US.
#     
#  2. Grand Rapids (MI), Portland (OR), and Chicago (IL) are the best
#      places to visit if you are looking to tour a lot of breweries in one city.
#     
#  3. American IPAs are the most commonly brewed beer at Craft Breweries.
#     
#  4. Nevada, Washington, D.C., and Kentucky brew the strongest beers.
