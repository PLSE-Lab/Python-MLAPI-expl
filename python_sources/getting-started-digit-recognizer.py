# Coding Neural Network, can be a daunting task for any beginner. It took me huge amount of time to figure out **The Hello World** programme. I've written down this kernel as an amalgamation from so many sources. This kernel consits of the bare minimum code, which can help any newcomer to get onboarded with Deep Learning. 
# 
# Most of the code is pretty self explanatory. I've provided explanations, wherever it took me a great amount of struggle.

#Restructure the data


#1. Separate Label and Image Pixels
train_label = train["label"]
train_images = train.drop(labels = ["label"], axis = 1)

#2. Normalize the data (Since, 255 is the max value)
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test = test / 255.0

#3. Reshape the data - From scalar to actual image format -?? 
train_images = train_images.values.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
test = test.values.reshape(-1,28,28,1)

#4. Label Encoding - Changing classes to 0/1 matrices
train_label = to_categorical(train_label, num_classes = 10)
