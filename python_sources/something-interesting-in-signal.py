# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# I'm not very skilled in signal analysis.
# But decided to share smth interesting, finded in data.
# 
# If we filter frequencies below 30_000 and then recover signal via inverse discrete Fourier Transform, then we got some periodical result.
# Am i right, we have some periodical component in high freqs?
# Can somebody explain what does it mean?
