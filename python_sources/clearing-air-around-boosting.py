# Top problem of Boosting is that it can overfit very easily. So most parameters you will see here are to reduce overfitting.
# For better generality and reducing overfitting at the same time you will have to optimize select params (bec. of time boundation).
# One more problem which `still` can occur is target leakage, which CatBoost tries to reduce.

# 
# #### Control Overfitting
# When you observe high training accuracy, but low test accuracy, it is likely that you encountered overfitting problem.
# 
# There are in general two ways that you can control overfitting in XGBoost:
# 
# 1. The first way is to directly control model complexity.
#      * This includes `max_depth`, `min_child_weight` and `gamma`.
# 1. The second way is to add randomness to make training robust to noise.
#      * This includes `subsample` and `colsample_bytree`.
#      * You can also reduce stepsize `eta`. Remember to increase `num_round` when you do so.
# 
# 
# #### Handle Imbalanced Dataset
# For common cases such as ads clickthrough log, the dataset is extremely imbalanced. This can affect the training of XGBoost model, and there are two ways to improve it.
# 
# 1. If you care only about the overall performance metric (AUC) of your prediction
#     * Balance the positive and negative weights via `scale_pos_weight`
#     * Use AUC for evaluation
# 1. If you care about predicting the right probability
#     * In such a case, you cannot re-balance the dataset
#     * Set parameter `max_delta_step` to a finite number (say 1) to help convergence
