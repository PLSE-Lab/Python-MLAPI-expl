# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#load the iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data[:,[0,2]]
y = iris.target

print('Class labels:', np.unique(y))

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, stratify = y)

sc = StandardScaler()
sc.fit(X_train)
X_train_std = sc.transform(X_train)
X_test_std = sc.transform(X_test)


ppn = Perceptron(max_iter = 40, eta0=0.1, random_state = 1)
ppn.fit(X_train_std, y_train)

y_pred = ppn.predict(X_test_std)
print('Accuracy: %2f' %accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
