# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #Library for general visualizations
import seaborn as sns #For more beautiful visualizations
import numpy as np #Library that handles mathematical operations
import pandas as pd #Working with .csv files
import time #General Python time library

#Magic command to the jupyter notebook that we want all visualizations to stay within the file

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# Loading the files to the variable:
