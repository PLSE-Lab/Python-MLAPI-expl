# # Avoiding Search Term Insufficiency for CORD-19
# 
# ## Abstract
# The "COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge" (CORD-19) is a call to action "to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions" from a rapidly growing body of literature. Using "bag-of-word" text searches on large document sets is very popular, but often produces very large result sets. Coping with large result sets by using a one-size-fits-all ranking algorithm and paginated display of results is inferior to using more targeted search terms which are sufficient to limit results without missing relevant documents.  We introduce an improved methodology designed to provide searchers 
# - a means to search titles and abstracts of the CORD-19 dataset, (which avoids the risks and limitations of bag-of-words searches on high-context technical prose in most scientific literature), 
# - a means to view collated results displayed under MeSH subject headings, 
# - a means to deliberately and confidently choose to exclude documents under subject headings that are irrelevant to their purposes, 
# - a means to locate other documents at the relevant MeSH subject headings which can be used to suggest additional or more targeted search terms, and 
# - a means to consider documents that were were omitted.
# 
# The ability to produce a manageable, custom-tailored full result set without the risks of general-purpose ranking and pagination allows the quality of the search to be evaluated rather than assumed.
# 
# ## This notebook is a report of results for a single CORD-19 task.
# To avoid duplicating these sections, please see Background, Explanation, Methodology, and Pros and Cons in the companion notebook [Avoiding Search Term Insufficiency in CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/forrestcavalier/avoiding-search-term-insufficiency-in-cord-19). This notebook is just for a single Challenge Task submission.

<small>(PMID32155789</small>)
<br>...Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public <b>health</b> emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to <b>psychological</b> resilience...<b>Psychological</b> impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised  (IES-R), and mental <b>health</b> status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21)...Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated <b>health</b> status were significantly associated with a greater <b>psychological</b> impact of the outbreak and higher levels  of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05)...Specific up-to-date and accurate <b>health</b> information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with  a lower <b>psychological</b> impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05)...Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of <b>psychological</b> impact and better mental <b>health</b> status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable  groups during the COVID-19 epidemic..
