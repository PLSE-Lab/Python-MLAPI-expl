# Next, I am dropping the 'Neutral' sentiments as my goal was to only differentiate positive and negative tweets. After that, I am filtering the tweets so only valid texts and words remain.  Then, I define the number of max features as 2000 and use Tokenizer to vectorize and convert text into Sequences so the Network can deal with it as input.

# Next, I compose the LSTM Network. Note that **embed_dim**, **lstm_out**, **batch_size**, **droupout_x** variables are hyperparameters, their values are somehow intuitive, can be and must be played with in order to achieve good results. Please also note that I am using softmax as activation function. The reason is that our Network is using categorical crossentropy, and softmax is just the right activation method for that.

My educated guess here is that the positive training set is dramatically smaller than the negative, hence the "bad" results for positive tweets.
