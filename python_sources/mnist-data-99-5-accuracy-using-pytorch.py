# In this notebook I have created a CNN model built in PyTorch to predict MNIST dataset. 
# **I was able to achieve 99.3% accuracy**. I also tested my model using a random image for internet and the prediction was perfect.

# **As seen I got really good accuracy and my model predicted all the new images correctly, which it has never seen before.**
# **As you can see it amount of coding that has to be done is much more when using PyTorch over Tensorflow**
# **I prefer working with Tensorflow & Keras because its simple to use.**
