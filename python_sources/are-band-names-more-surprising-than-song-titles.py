# We want to see to how surpsing song titles are given a langauge model trained on a realted corpus.
# 
# So what we're going to do:
# 
# * train a langauge model on some of these lyrics
# * evaluate the pelxity of band names
# * evaluate the plexity of short phrases taken from the held out lyrics 

# In[ ]:
