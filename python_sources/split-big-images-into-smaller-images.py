# This note book is just has an utility function, where we have very big images and we want to **split them into smaller tile images.**

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from fastai import *
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2 
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# # Example call:
# # Split all the training images
# subtile_images('/home/../images', '.tif',
#                '/home/../trn_images', '.png',
#                500, 500)


# Note here that 500 x 500 in above example is the size, which possible size for source images, i.e. all the .tif files to be splitted are 5000 x 5000. 
# > So, this has to taken care by user of this utility.

# ** HAPPY TILES!**
