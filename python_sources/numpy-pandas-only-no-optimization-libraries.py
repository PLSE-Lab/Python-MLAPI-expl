# ## Go Rudolf, go!
# 
# In this script I am gonna get Rudolf and his fellow reindeers a bit tired since I am not using an optimization packages to lay down the ex-ante shortest path. Instead, in each step of santa's trip, I am calculating the next closer city and send him there to dispatch gifts. Every tenth city he visits I am penalizing all cities except the primes with 10% distance increase as the problem requires. The process is repeated until all the graph is traversed. 
# 
# Sorry Rudolf! I am going to make you another script with optimization to compensate!
