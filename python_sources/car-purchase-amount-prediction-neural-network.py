# Welcome to the Car Purchase Amount Prediction case study. This is the very basic case study.
# Here we will simply see how to load data, Visualize data, clean data, train test split, prepare model, predict and evaluate.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# We do not need customer name, email and country as these factors will not affect your purchase.
# also we will remove car purchase amount column as it is our target column and target column should not be in input matrix.
# in y we will only store our target column.

# If you will not scale your data, model will predict terrible things. Your data should be in same scale. IT makes your model more accurate and faster.
# So lets scale our data with min-max scaler.
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
y = y.values.reshape(-1, 1)
y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(y)

# So according to below figure you will see that for the first 20 epochs our model showing a big drop in loss or you can say improvement.
# but after that improvement is constant or not that much significant. So from here we can conclude that for given number of nuerons we can only use 20-25 epochs to get a good model.

# At the end i will suggest you to play with model's hyper paramters. You should try with different number or models and epochs and try to see what result you get. There is not best
# value. It all depends upon your data and your observations.
