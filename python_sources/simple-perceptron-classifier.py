# # Data
# After loading the data, store it in the following format:
# 
# **Labels** (vector of length 42000)
# 
# **Training Data** (matrix of shape 42000,784; the labels are sliced off)
# 
# Each handwritten digit used for training is stored as a row in a matrix. 
# Each row is 784 points long; this represents
# pixel intensities of an image which is 28 by 28 pixels. The row must be reshaped in order to visualize it.
# 
# **Weights** (list of vectors, one vector for each class. 10 by 784)
# 
# Each weight vector is the same length as a handwritten digit vector.

# # Perceptron Learning (training)
# For each handwritten digit in the data set, compare its vector to each of the weight 
# vectors by taking the dot product. 
# 
# The largest resulting dot product is the 'guess'.
# If the guess is wrong, the incorrect weight vector is updated by subtracting the
# digit vector and the correct weight vector is updated by adding the digit vector.
# 
# This routine repeats through the dataset many times (epochs) until the number of wrong guesses
# begins to stabilize (in this case, 15 epochs. If you were to run 20 epochs, you'd see overfitting).
