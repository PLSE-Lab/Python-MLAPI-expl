# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

#Geographical Plotting from various data:
#The choropleth maps of plotly is very useful afor geographical plotting:
#It is a thematic map in which areas are shaded in proportion to a statististical variable 
#that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristics within each area, such as population density or GDP
import plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go

#First we need to create a data dictionary because plotly only accepts certain types of data

#Other type of available colorscales:'pairs' | 'Greys' | 'Greens' | 'Bluered' | 'Hot' | 'Picnic' | 'Portland' | 'Jet' | 'RdBu' | 'Blackbody' | 'Earth' | 'Electric' | 'YIOrRd' | 'YIGnBu'

# we also need to create a layout object of plotly:

go.Figure(data,layout)# this is the function we call the graph of the map
# here we pass the two necessary object into figure function
