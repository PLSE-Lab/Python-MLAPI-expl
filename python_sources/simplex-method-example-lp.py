# ## Implementation of The Simplex Algorithm via Matrix Operations
# 
# The following code implements the Simplex method with matrix operations, as opposed to the tableau method.  
# 
# We begin by writing out a constrained optimization problem in *standard form* below.  The matrix $A$ holds the coefficients of the inequality constraints, the vector $b$ is the vector of solutions, and the vector $c$ holds the coefficients of the variables of the objective function that is being optimized.

# User Defined Input

# Example Input
A = np.array([[-2, 1, 1, 0, 0],
             [-1, 2, 0, 1, 0],
             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]])

b = np.array([2, 7, 3])

c = np.array([-1, -2, 0, 0, 0])


# Now, we continue to establish the function ``Simplex`` that solves a linear constrained optimization problem using a matrix method implementation of the Simplex Algorithm.

# As seen above, the function ``Simplex`` outputs the correct values.  ``Simplex`` returns more information than necessary (it does not just return the solution), but it can be useful to see the final values of all the key matrices it uses in the algorithm, so we may gain an intuition into what is going on.
