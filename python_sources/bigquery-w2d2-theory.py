# Good day, Mr. Truong. Welcome back! How's your job?
# Lots of things going on. I still feel confused a lot about many things like the organization, etc.
# Ah, it's typical, it's common, and it's a double-sword.
# What do you mean?
# Well, kids nowadays get discouraged very easily. For example, lots of people you see always say
# I want to do this, I want to that, Can we do this, I want to do a kick-ass project, only fail to provide
# an actionable write-up--a concrete goal or proposal that you can stick to.
# Hmmm... this happens to me many times.
# Anyways, today we'll learn about AS for aliasing and WITH... AS for readability through the use of CTE
# To get started, load the dataset `crypto_bitcoin`. Hope you can still remember the code.
# Yes, sir!

from google.cloud import bigquery # talk to the sales guy
client = bigquery.Client() # create an account
dataset_ref = client.dataset('crypto_bitcoin', project='bigquery-public-data') # create a handler to the dataset
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref) # fetch the dataset through an API request
table_ref = dataset_ref.table('transactions') # create a handler to the `crypto_bitcoin` table
trans = client.get_table(table_ref) # fetch the table through an API request
client.list_rows(trans, max_results=5).to_dataframe()

# Feeling shaky?
# Kind of. But hey, I got the job done.
# Hmmm... I'll let you get away from it this time.
# Now query the number of transactions per day, sorted by date. Remember to use CTE for practice purpose
