#let's work on Boston dataset using Linear Regression and compare the scores

#we had things like 'data' and 'target' in that bunch. (target denotes output)
x=boston.data #we're setting names for those
y=boston.target #-----------------(x is input and y is output)-------------


# In[ ]:


print(x,"\n",y) #still the data is not clear to us

x.shape #let's look at shape
#it says 506 rows and 13 columns


# In[ ]:


#to see the data clearly, we use pandas

#in that bunch, we saw something named 'feature_names'  #we suppose it to be column name

#only then, you must go ahead with the rest

#we had a thing called DESCR in that bunch (always look for description in the bunch) and analyse it
