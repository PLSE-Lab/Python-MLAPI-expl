#We will continue from the previous dataset

import pandas as pd

realEstTrans = pd.read_csv('../input/Sacramentorealestatetransactions.csv')
realEstTrans.head(50)


# In[ ]:


#Let's try to do some filtering
#Let's say you want to get all the data where the 'street' has the word 'WAY'in it

realEstTrans.loc[realEstTrans['street'].str.contains('WAY')]
#Now will say all the results will have streets that contains the word 'WAY'
#realEstTrans.loc[~realEstTrans['street'].str.contains('WAY')]
#The above line with the character '~' is similar to a NOT operator. Try it out

#Lets's go a step further
#We can also use regex for more complex operations
#Say we need to know the rows where 'street' has either the words 'ST' or 'AVE'
import re
realEstTrans.loc[realEstTrans['street'].str.contains('st|ave', flags=re.I, regex=True)]

#Here we initialy import the regex library, then we use it in our method
#As you can see i have typed in lower case 'st|ave' even though the data is in UPPER
#But this can be a issue if the data set is very big where we do not know if there were
#any lower case characters. So we use the flags=re.I where we basically say to ignore the case


# In[ ]:


#Let's say you want to find all the records where the 'street' number begins from a 4
realEstTrans.loc[realEstTrans['street'].str.contains('^4[0-9]*', flags=re.I, regex=True)]

#Here we use the basic rules of regex as in python. Play around to know more


# In[ ]:


#Let's do some changes to the data
#Suppose we need to replace the 'type' Residential to Normal, we do the following
realEstTrans.loc[realEstTrans['type'] == 'Residential', 'type'] = 'Normal'
realEstTrans.head(10)
#There you go !! We can see 'Residential has been replaced with the word 'Normal'


# In[ ]:


#We can also do changes to other columns based on conditions of another column
#Let's say you want to change the 'type' to 'Luxury' if the price greater than 90000

realEstTrans.loc[realEstTrans['price'] > 90000, 'type'] = 'Luxury'
realEstTrans.head(10)

#So now you will see the type of house that has a price greater than 90K has been changed as 'Luxury'
#We also can have multiple condition as well as multiple parameters. Do some self exploration on that.


# In[ ]:


#Let's try to do some aggregate functions
#We can find the average price of different types of residences by using the .mean() method
realEstTrans.groupby(['type']).mean()


# In[ ]:


#We need only price but here you see, we get all the columns additional columns. 
#To solve that problem, we do the following

realEstTrans.groupby(['type']).mean()['price']
#We also can play with various way in this. Please refer the documentation to find out how !!
