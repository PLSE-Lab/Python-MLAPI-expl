# With so many impressive codes and extensive explanations of the 'magic', the only thing i can add is the following: never give up.
# I was struggling a lot to find this features that were supposed to improve the score of the model. I tried different things, from feature interactions to ARIMA, from counts of positives and negatives to fourier coefficient, nothing seemed to work. At one point i said in the forum that I did not think i could get into the bronze medal range (being this my first kaggle competition) but that it was worth following the competition becouse of the great kernels and discussions posted from all of you... (so much to learn!!)
# 
# But I did not give up and kept trying new stuff untill the end... since there were so many hints in the forum, I knew the magic has to be on value counts... in employing the frequency is some way. Finally, with just a few hours to competition deadline, I managed to get into silver range (157th place). So here it goes:

            'countvar_158','countvar_96']


# The plot for var_61 did not have to mean anything, just that there are more unique values, hence the frequency for all of them is lower. But, this could give some kind of categorical features. I decided to divide the actual row value by its corresponding frequency, hoping to get some sort of 'pseudo-categories'. If some specific values repeat to much, then those values will get divided by a large amount and end up as low values. Values that have a low frequency will keep their magnitude... etc. This could be more evident in columns with low standard deviation... had to try.

# Sadly, the first time I trained the model there was an error at the end of the code and could not save the predictions. Luckily I was able to recover the information about the last fold and send the submission with just that information, got into silver range with 0.909 and had a confirmation that the method worked... And enough time to run the prediction again. I used only 3 folds since there was really not that much time left. Sent the submission with 0.9117 CV and got the final score of 0.91342 for the 157th place in the private LB and the silver in my first kaggle competition.

# I learnt a lot from all of you, and have to learn much more from the already published kenerls, so a huge thanks.

# And yeah... nothing new here and nothing to rival the GM uncles, but a good lesson... never give up !
