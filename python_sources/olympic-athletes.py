# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # matplotlib for additional customization
import seaborn as sns # Seaborn for plotting and styling
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# US vs. China, which country performed better in terms of the Olympic medal numbers?
# According to the violinplot, the most frequent medal US and China got is the same - Silver.
# However, American got more Gold medal and less Bronze medal than China. So, US performed better in the Olympic history.
