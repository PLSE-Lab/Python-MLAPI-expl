# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES
###

# Variable: A named reference to a value
quantity = 144

# Data Type: A Specific kind of variable (e.g. Integer, String, List)

# Number: numbers come in two flavors
# Integer: whole numbers (e.g. 1,2,3)
i = 12
# Float: A floating-point/decimal number can hold fractional values (e.g. 1.0, 0.25 13.79)
f = 33.33
half = 1.0 / 2.0

# String: An ordered sequence of characters
student_name = "Alice Jones"

# List: A list is an ordered collection of values that can be referenced by position in the list [0,1,2,3,...]
# 0 is the index of the first item, 1 is the second item 2 is the third item etc
# -1 is the last item -2 is the second to the last item

first_person = people[0]
last_person = people[-1]

quarterly_sales_for_year = [100, 75, 50, 200]

#Dictionary: a dictionary is an unordered collection of values that can be accessed by a name known as a key like a phone book or library
phone_book = {"Bob": "555-555-2222", "Carol": "555-555-3333", "Ted": "555-555-4444", "Alice": "555-555-1111"}
