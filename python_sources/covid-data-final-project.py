# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

For Honolulu and Snohomish, it seems as though the curve is flattening, whereas with Maricopa, the number of cases is continuing to exponentially increase.

# This graph shows the correlation between cases and deaths in all US counties. Because many of the counties in the data set have lower amounts of cases, there is a cluster of stars towards the beginning of the graph. However, the correlation seems to be very strong otherwise, as the line of best fit is pretty close to the line made of stars.
