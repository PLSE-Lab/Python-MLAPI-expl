# This is a script that I wrote to parse through submission CSVs and change each assigned day to each value from 1 to 100. It takes forever to run, and so far hasn't given any output worth mentioning. Does anybody have any advice? I don't understand optimization algorithms enough, so this is my supplement for not being able to advance my score any more.
