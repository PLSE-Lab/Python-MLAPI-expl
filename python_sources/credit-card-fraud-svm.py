# The diagonal across the heatmap represents the highest correlation (close to 1.0) and the correlation between other pairs of features has values between -0.2 to 0.2, which corresponds to very less correlation. This represents the features mentioned are indeed independent of each other and hence no feature can be eliminated based on their dependency on each other

#Since the number of total fraudulent transactions is too small as compared to non-fraudulent transactions, we need to resample the dataset.

#Accuracy alone is not a good metric to determine the final result since the number of non-fraudulent transactions heavily outnumber the fraudulent transactions
#For a banking system, it's fine if some non-fraudulent transactions are detected as fraudulent, they'll look into it, but if fraudulent transactions are labelled as non-fraudulent, then that can cause huge losses. Hence, our objective is to reduce the total number of false negatives as much as possible and on the same hand, try that the number of false positives are on the lower side as well.
