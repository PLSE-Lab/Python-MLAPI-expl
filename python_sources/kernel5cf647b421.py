# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, ElasticNetCV # Lasso is L1, Ridge is L2, ElasticNet is both
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit # For cross validation
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import lightgbm as lgb # LightGBM is an alternative to XGBoost. I find it to be faster, more accurate and easier to install.

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games/appstore_games.csv')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
