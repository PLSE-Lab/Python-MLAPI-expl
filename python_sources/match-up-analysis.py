# I wanted to focus on a particular league for my analysis so I am grabbing the Premier League data first.

# Once I grab the data I am selecting just the columns I want to use.  Since there are so many.  Later

# ## The Main Function ##
# Below is the main function in the notebook.  It goes through the match data and creates match ups and appends them to a list.  Basically I wanted to gather all possible match up combinations that have occurred so I could better analyze them individually or grouped up at higher levels.
# 
# As you will see below I figure out which team was playing as the home team in the match and generate stats on home wins and losses as well as away wins and losses.  Also add up things like total goals scored in the match up by one team vs the other.
