"""
On first glance, the map has a couple of nice features. It gives a good overview of not only how a sector's funding is disbursed
throughout the world, but also how a region's funding breaks down by sector. That being said, there are 324 bubbles on the map, 
so most of them are too small for us to get a good look at them. For further investigation, it might be interesting to zoom in 
on an area of interest to get a better view.

Below is a zoomed-in plot of Central America using the same dataset as above. Note that the basemap projection has been switched 
to mercator, and the markersize has been increased dramatically.
