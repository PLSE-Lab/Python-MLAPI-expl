# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns  # visualization tool

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# * **CONCLUSION**
# 
# 
# We saw the most powerful Pokemon is Arceus
# 
# 
# * **Little Note**
# 
# 
# I'm EEE but same time I'm drawer. We need to be diffrent hobbies. We need to like life and World. World is beatiful please You work to see.
