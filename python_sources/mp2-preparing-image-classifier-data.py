# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
#for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    #for filename in filenames:
     #   print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session


# # Mini Project 2: Preparing Data for Image Classifier
# 
# For this Kaggle notebook, I plan to clean and prepare the data in the stanford cars dataset. Ultimately, the goal is to place each set of images into separate folders based on its model. For example, 50 images of a 2012 Audi TT in one folder. After using this to separate and classify the data, I will upload them in teachable machine to create the image classifier.
