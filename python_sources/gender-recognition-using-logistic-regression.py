# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Firstly, look the data for what we have:

# In[ ]:


data.info()


# In[ ]:


data.head()


# In[ ]:


# We need to classificate to genders, so we have to make labels integer rather than object. I decided to make 1 as man, 0 as woman. (I'm not sexist, it is only for implementation, no offense :) )
data.label = [1 if each == 'male' else 0 for each in data.label]


# In[ ]:


# Our new data
data.label.head() # 1's are for male


# In[ ]:


data.label.tail() # 0's are for females


# In[ ]:


y = data.label.values # set y as our genders
x_data = data.drop(['label'],axis=1) # other features in x_data 


# In[ ]:


# Normalization process is important for making data relevant, 
# which means it is kind of a protection of small datas for avoiding pressure of big datas. (Ex: 0.01 cannot be observed due to 1024.92)  
# This process makes all values between 0 and 1
