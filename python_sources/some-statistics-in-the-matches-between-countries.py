# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

data=pd.read_csv("../input/results.csv")
#read_csv command opens the file in the "../input/results.csv" directory


# In[ ]:


data.info()
#The info() command in the results.csv shows properties such as column names, types, and number of data.


# In[ ]:


data.head()
#the head() command shows the first 5 elements in the results.csv
