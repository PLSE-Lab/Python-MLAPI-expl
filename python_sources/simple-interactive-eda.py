# ## Welcome to the EDA.
# ## For this dataset I have a plan to fully explore this awesome dataset which I will update on a weekly basis.
# ### Do comment to discuss new approaches for EDA on this dataset

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

summary = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/air-pollution-in-seoul/AirPollutionSeoul/Measurement_summary.csv')

# In[ ]:


#As you might observe that the lower point ie station code 119 is more in the city center hence it would be expected to recorder higher levels of PM2.5
#So definetly location will be a key factor

#Lets not look at how is each month over the years performs as a function of pollutions in PM2.5


# In[ ]:

# In[ ]:


#The month of March observes on average maximum PM2.5 Levels

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(20, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Month', y='PM2.5', data=df, showfliers=False);
#Pm2.5 Levels by Stations


# In[ ]:


#Looking at the boxplots gives similar results. The variation from months 6-9 is small probably due to rains during those months.
