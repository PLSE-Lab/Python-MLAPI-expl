# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import scipy as sp
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls"]))
print("Hi")

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

a=np.array([1,2])
b=np.array([2,1])

print(np.dot(a,b))
print(a.dot(b))

#going with plotting
x=np.linspace(0,10,100)
y=np.sin(x)
