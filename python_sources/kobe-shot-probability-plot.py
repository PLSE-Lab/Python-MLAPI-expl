# We want to plot the probabilities of a shot from a given area. However we need to take into account that in itself this probability can be misleading. We need to consider that Kobe did not used all areas equally for shooting, some were tried few times and some (e.g. around the net) were visited several times. You might want to plot the distribution of visits to see that it's not normal. Here instead of tranforming it, I just winsorized the values. This way you can see his favourite spots. Interestingly, his probability has rather low variance, and seems that he doesn't prefered those spots because there he more likely shot.
