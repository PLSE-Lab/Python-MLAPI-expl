# # US Accident Anaysis
# 
# ## Introduction
# The data from this analysis is from [kaggle US Accidents: A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), which contains accident data are collected from February 2016 to December 2019 in 49 US states, more documentation about this data can be found [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).
# 
# The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the data and find out what are the key variables that impact the **severity** of the traffic accidents that happened in US and ultimately predict the severity of the accidents based on given variables through **data visulization** and **regression analysis** using Python.
# 
# ## Loading data
# 
# The analysis starts with loading data and necessary library.

# Checking Columns for nas

# In[ ]:


# Check each column for nas

# Cleanning the data by removing unnecessary columns that won't be used in the analysis. Then review the cleaned dataset

# In[ ]:

# To prepare the dataset for further analysis, some additional columns are added
# 
# - Time_Diff: Time difference between start time and end time of the accident
# - Year: Year of start time
# - Month: Month of start time
# - Day: Day of start time
# - Hour: Hour of start time
# 
# During this step, also excluded records in 2015 and 2020 where there aren't enough data in these two years. This should give us a relatively clean dataset to start the analysis.

# ## Data Visualization
# 
# First group the data by **year** and **Severity** and use `size()` to count the records in each group, then use `unstack()` to pivot the result.
# 
# Most of the accidents falls under **Severity 2 and 3** and the number of accidents are increasing year over year.

# Then plot the data by **Severity** and by **Year** to show the trend of accidents by year and by accident severity.

# From the plot, we can see that:
# 
# - **Severity 2** accidents are *increasing* year over year in a rapid speed
# - **Severity 3** accidents have seen a *decrease* in 2019 compared to 2018
# - **Severity 1 and 4** are relatively flat year over year

# 
# Below is a boxplot of **Temperature** and **Severity**, we can see that there are almost no difference in median temparature in Severity 1,2 and 3, while lower medium temperature in severity 4, which might indicate that lower temperature might result to more severe accidents.

# 
# ## Regression Analysis
# 
# After data visualization, we have a brief understanding of the dataset as well as the variables to choose for the regression analysis.
# 
# Since the dependent variable is **Severity**, which is a categorical variable. Logestic Regression model is chosen to perform the analysis.
# 
# The independent variables are selected based on the previous analysis:
# 
# - Distance(mi)
# - Time_Diff
# - Temperature(F)
# - Wind_Chill(F)
# - Humidity(%)
# - Pressure(in)
# - Visibility(mi)
# - Wind_Speed(mph)
# - Precipitation(in)
# 
# Using `sklearn` library, first separate the dependent variable **y** and independent variable **x** and store them in separate objects. The use `scale()` from `preprocessing` module to properly scale the **x** variable before the regression.
# 
# Next step will be using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` module to split test and train dataset. Finally fit the logestic regression model.

# In[ ]:


variable = ["Severity","Distance(mi)","Time_Diff","Temperature(F)","Wind_Chill(F)","Humidity(%)",
           "Pressure(in)","Visibility(mi)","Wind_Speed(mph)","Precipitation(in)"]

model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs',multi_class='multinomial',max_iter=1000)
model.fit(train_x, train_y)


# Use `score()` to evaluate the model, the model gets 0.72, which is decent for the first try.

# In[ ]:


model.score(test_x, test_y)


# Finally use `confusion_matrix` to see how many of the prediction are correct and how many are incorrect.
# 
# We can see that **Severity 2 and 3** are the most accidents. The model did a good job in identifing **Severity 2** but not **Severity 3**.
