# This notebook is written by an unpaid intern at Santa's office who doesn't know Stochastic product search, Mixed integer programming, Hungraian algorithm and so on.. but has best interest in his heart to help santa as he saw santa stressed like this looking at the prefrence list.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os

# As usual, we need to import the libraries to manipulate tabular data and show graphs.
