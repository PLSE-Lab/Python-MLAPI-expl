network.add(keras.layers.Dense(10,activation=tf.nn.softmax)) #Softmax will generate the probability distributions of the output. The layer is predicting that the probability that the label is 1 is 0.10, label is 2 is 0.50 and so on. These all add upto 1. The number with the highest probability is treated as our models prediction. To fin the the number we just need to know the index of the number with higest probability (this is achieved by using numpy argmax function on the output)

#Compile the model with required loss, metrics and optimizer function
network.compile(metrics=['accuracy'], optimizer='adam',loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy') 
# Categorical Cross Entropy is used for categorization problems. Sparse is used for numeric output.
# the loss function tells the model how to measure loss. The target for the optimizer then becomes to reduce the loss.
# Therefore, its essential that we choose to optimize the right loss value.

#fit the training data on the network
history = network.fit(train_x,train_y,epochs=15)
# Epochs simply means total number of iterations over test samples. Each iteraiton will cover all samples. There is an option of specifiying a batch size. If lets say we have 10,000 samples and we say batch size is 1000 then 10 batches will be processes in each epoch.
#history will store the accuracy and loss stats for each epoch. This would help us analyze the cost/benfit of running epochs. Accuracy will flatten after certain number of epochs and so would the loss. Thus additional epochs will only consume CPU and memory. so there is an oppurtunitiy to tune the parameters when compiling based on this analysis.

# 96-97 % accuracy achieved by model. Main improvement was due to the introduction of data normalization and flatten layers in the network. Try removing these changes and see the negative impact on performance.
# The drop in accurach from training to test data reflects the fact that the model was overfitting (memorzing the results) on training data.
