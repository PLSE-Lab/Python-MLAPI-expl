# ### In this kernel we try to get a basic understanding of the problem and explore a few simple solutions to see a how they differ.

# In case you haven't already figured it out, this is a version of the ["Traveling Salesman Problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). May be the winning solution is going to be one of the very advanced approaches to that problem. But let us not get scared by an NP-Complete problem. We will start with some simple dumb approaches first and see where they lead us. 
# 

# Let us first load the file and look at the data.

# **So it looks like the cities are arranged in a reindeer pattern**. 
# * The red dot indicates the North Pole (CityId = 0). 
# * All we have to a do a is a find a path that goes from the red dot, touches all the other dots, and comes back to the red-dot, with minimum total distance travelled !

# ## Dumbest Path: Go in the order of CityIDs: 0, 1, 2.. etc. and come back to zero when you reach the end.

# Per the problem: **"submission is scored on the Euclidean distance of your submitted path, subject to the constraint that every 10th step is 10% more lengthy unless coming from a prime CityId."**

# ## Genetic Algorithm
# 
# Basic Description
# Genetic algorithms are inspired by Darwin's theory about evolution. Solution to a problem solved by genetic algorithms is evolved.
# 
# Algorithm is started with a set of solutions (represented by chromosomes) called population. Solutions from one population are taken and used to form a new population. This is motivated by a hope, that the new population will be better than the old one. Solutions which are selected to form new solutions (offspring) are selected according to their fitness - the more suitable they are the more chances they have to reproduce.
# 
# Outline of the Basic Genetic Algorithm
# * **[Start]** Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)
# * **[Fitness]** Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population
#     * **[New population]** Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete
#     * **[Selection]** Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)
#     * **[Crossover]** With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents.
#     * **[Mutation]** With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).
#     * [Accepting] Place new offspring in a new population
# * **[Replace]** Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm
# * **[Test]** If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population
# * **[Loop]** Go to step 2
