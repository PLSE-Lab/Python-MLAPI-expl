# Access different features/columns like a dictionary.

# Each column is a Series object, basically a normal list where 
# all elements have the same type (str, float, int, etc.) with 
# some new helpful methods and functions thrown in, feel free 
# to read the names of the methods. For most methods reading 
# the name is enough. It's pretty easy to guess that the .sum() 
# method of a Series of numbers does.

data['AGE'].head()

# To get specific elements of a DataFrame or Series using their positions use the 'iloc' attribute.

data['AGE'].iloc[50]

# data.iloc[50] will obviously also work
