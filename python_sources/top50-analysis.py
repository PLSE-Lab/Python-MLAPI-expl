# Conclusions: 
# The top 50 have more songs which are like party songs with more value of Danceability field.
# The songs are medium to fast pace songs, more on the medium side. there are no or very less slow songs in top 50 as per the 
# beats per minute value.

# Songs from latin, dance pop, pop, canadian hip hop, edm Genres are very popular here.

# Most of the songs are studio recorded ones and very few are live recorded songs, this could be due to the noise/clarity 
# issues with live recorded songs.

# Most of the songs time ranges between 150-225 seconds, that would be 2.5 to 3.5 minutes. People have listened to songs 
# which are not too short or too long. Maybe because the short songs end too soon and long songs get boring..

# There is correlation between energy and loudiness of song -> may be loud songs sound more energetic.

# Both positive and negative songs have almost equally made to the top50 list. There are equal happy and sad songs.

# The distribution of Speechiness plot tells that most of songs have less of words and more Music.
