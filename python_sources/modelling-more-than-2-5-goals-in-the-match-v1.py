# # European Soccer Database
# ### This Notebook is intended to be the third in a series, using this dataset.
# Started May 2019 by Stephen Howard.
# 
# In the first Notebook, I did some basic analysis of all of the data. In the second Notebook, I carried out a deeper analysis of the match data with a particular focus on the number of goals scored in each match.
# 
# In this Notebook, I will develop a model to predict whether a match is expected to have over 2.5 goals. This is a standard over/under bet offered on soccer matches and I will parameterise the model to maximise the AUC score. This work will be based on some assumptions:
# - The total number of goals scored in a match follows a Poisson distribution. I will attempt to learn a suitable lambda parameter for each match, given the input variable.

# My intention is to follow these processes:
# - Take 80% of the data through as training data, splitting the remaining data equally into test and cross-validation data.
# - On the training data, set up a model to estimate the probability a match has more than 2.5 goals.
# - This model can be tested as a classification model using standard tests (e.g. accuracy, F1-score).
# - I will then test the outcome of following a number of different betting strategies, using the model, on the test data. If odds cannot be determined, I will have to make an assumption.
# - Finally, the model and betting strategy can be tested on the cross-validation data.
