# Ensembling can be a valuable tool for combining the insights of many different machine learning models.  Given the nature of this problem (rank the 5 most likely), a different ensembling algorithm than mere averaging must be used.  Here, I employ an ensembling algorithm that was recently very successful in a recent image recognition competition, [Quick! Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition/discussion/73738).
