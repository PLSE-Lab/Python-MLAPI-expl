# Please check the trend "Best choices" and as we know most the families prefer to attending at weekends or the last day before Christmas.
# 
# In the current submission file(for example) as we can see occupation in 65,72,79,86,93 days equal exactly 125 its because for daily occupancy 125 we don't have accounting penalty for prev day.
# 
# And it's a great trick for minimizing occupation on Monday("bad" day) and maximize on Sunday(good day). 
# 
# But we have 2 reasons why we don't use that trick every Monday:
# * Days what closer to Christmas actually better and better and 2nd day before Christmas we totally cant use that trick
# * If we use a simple algorithm with swap families/days usually we can't get exactly 125 from 200+(for example) and if we slowly changing to 125 we increase accounting penalty almost to infinity.

# > Daily occupation changed and we even improved preference cost, but... our accounting penalty increased?!
# 
# Yes, and it's a good time to run your algorithm, because after that you must improve score. (I improved 71261 -> 70591)
