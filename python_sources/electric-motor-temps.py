# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# The relation between stator tooth temp and stator winding temp seem quite linear. This should be perfectly fit for linear regression.
