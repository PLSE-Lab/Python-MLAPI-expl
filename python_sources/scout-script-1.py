# This is very different from the world map, meaning most of the STATUS values

# Let's check

# WOW!, the measured values actually are disappearingly small in quantity
# Let's see what the other columns look like

# OCCURANCE_ID seems to be an index column

# yes, it's a index value, so we can safely ignore that (perhaps?)

# A lot of this is from Taiwan. I want to take a look at the X, Y world map again
# but this time with instance densities
sns.jointplot('X', 'Y', data=df, kind='kde')


# In[ ]:


# WOW. Looks like the only place the data is from is Taiwan
# This is bound to be a pretty important feature, though it will have little
# meaning if we try to predict a case's status. This is what bias in the data looks like.
# How about the distribution in years? That might show us something interesting
df.YEAR.value_counts().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 5))

# So this is mostly recent data. Fair enough, back then data collection would
# have been incredibly expensive too.

# This looks a lot like the LOCATION_TYPE. I'm leaving this out for someone else to make
# sense of. Now let's see the correlations.
# The -999 looks like a NA value, but I'm going to leave that in to make it easier for
# plotting later on
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)


# In[ ]:


# This shows a lot of correlation, but I suppose that's simply because of the imbalance
# in data collection towards Taiwan, so it's probably not refelctive of anything.
# How about we visualize the XY again with different things as hue?

# A lot of this data is from very different places in the world. For instance I cannot find
# Russia out there. Also, India has moved up in the world, and Africa is quiet literally
# the dark continent.

# We'll be leaving it at that sicne this is a Scout Script and names must be obeyed.
# Feedback is welcome.
