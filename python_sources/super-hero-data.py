# Interesting, the mean puts villians with an average of one more superpower than the heros, but the neutral supers really pack a punch.
#Lets look at it on a boxplot though to get a better picture.

#There are a lot of outlier heros who have a ton of powers, which would pull the mean up. 
#Based on the interquartile range it looks like the majority of heros really do have a fewer number of superpowers than our villians.
#Ok, apparently super heros powers aren't what gives them such an advantage, maybe it's height or weight?

#Let's take a look:

#Hmmm. not too much height variation. What about weight?

#Good guys seem to be a little lighter, what if we compare their BMI?

# In[ ]:


#Look at that! Assuming that a healthy BMI range of 18.5-24.9 actually applies to super-people (don't think too much about it),
#there seems to be a correlation between being a good guy and being a healthy weight. 
#Maybe it's time to hit the gym!
