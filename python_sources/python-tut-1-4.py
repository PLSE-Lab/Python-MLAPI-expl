# The first thing to do is to import the relevant packages
# that I will need for my script, 
# these include the Numpy (for maths and arrays)
# and csv for reading and writing csv files
# If i want to use something from this I need to call 
# csv.[function] or np.[function] first

# The size() function counts how many elements are in
# in the array and sum() (as you would expects) sums up
# the elements in the array.
