# Hello! This is the very first notebook I will have written in kaggle. I have tried to make a simple neural network to predict whether or not a banking crisis will occur in a given country in a given year. Although the network is simple, it is over 90% accurate in its predictions, and does not tend to severly under-predict banking crises (note the confusion matrix). This neural network was constructed with the help of examples from the book "Neural Network Projects with Python" by James Loy, and some lines are taken directly from there. I know this isn't a data visualization tool, but I hope you find some interest in it. Thanks!
