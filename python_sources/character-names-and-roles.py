All three lives change when Vicky joins Karan and Sneha in college, and Sneha begins feeling drawn towards Vicky. Karan feels he has lost the only woman he has ever loved but knows he cannot do anything about it. The former tenant claims she's been murdered, but there's no record of a murder or even her death..
