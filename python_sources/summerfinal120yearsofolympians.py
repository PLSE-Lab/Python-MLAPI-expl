# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#using a file from our dataset pane

co= df.corr()
sn.heatmap(co,annot=True, linewidths=1.0)
#weight and height have a strong correlation
#age is most correlated with weight, probably because of metabolisms slowing.
#year isn't strongly correlated with other measurements which means that over time athletes are about the same in terms of height, weight and the composition of athletes hasn't changed over time.
