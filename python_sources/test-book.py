# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
a=9
b=2
c=-8
# this is the test of the function abs,min, and max.
print(float(a)+b,"absolute of c",abs(c),c,min(a,b,c),max(a,b,c))

def first_daladala(a,b,c):
    return(a+b+c)
print(first_daladala(a,b,c))
