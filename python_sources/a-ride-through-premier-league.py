# * Comebacks per season
# 
# ### Teams
# #### Home Games
# * Goals scored at home
# * Goals scored per home game
# * Highest Percentage of home games won
# * Points performance at home
# * Comebacks at home
# 
# #### Away games
# * Goals scored away
# * Goals scored per away game
# * Highest Percentage of away games won
# * Points performance
# * Comebacks
# 
# #### All Games
# * Distribution of wins at home and away

# 
# ### Conclusion
# * Goals scored in the last 19 seasons
# * Goals scored per game
# * Team with most wins
# * Team with most goals
# * Team with most goals per game
# * Team with most points earned
# 
# I'll not consider 2019/20 season as it was interrupted due to covid-19.
# 
# If you find any mistake or have any suggestion on something I can do better, please let me know.
