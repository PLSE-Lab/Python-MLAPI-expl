# Let's investigate the fields providede in the dataset and come up with questions we can ask.

# Questions to Answer
# ---
# 
# From the fields I compiled the following list of questions to answer:
# * Which person bought the most products on black friday?
# * What product selled the most on black friday?
# * In which city most money was spend?

# **Clean the dataset**

# Check for NaNs

# Classifiers examples
