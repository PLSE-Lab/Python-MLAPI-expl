# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#Understanding marginal emission factor
#Average emissions refers to the amount of emissions generated over a given time, divided by the amount of energy produced in that time.
#So for specific source, according to different types of primary_fuel calculate emission_factor 
#total_emission_factor = amount of emission generation over a given time/ amount of energy produced in that time
