# OVERVIEW

# I am conducting an exploratory data analysis on CFPB consumer complaints, with the aim to understand the broad composition of said complaints.

# The research questions I will address in this notebook include:
#     1. Which companies have the most complaints? (Sneak peek: the 3 major credit bureaus)
#     2. What are the most common complaint categories for the credit bureaus?
#     3. Have credit bureau complaints been consistent across time, or have they changed?
#     4. Identify which of the 3 credit bureaus are most likely to respond in a timely manner to complaints
#     5. Identify the most common outcomes of complaints to the 3 credit bureaus
#     6. Identify which of the 3 credit bureaus are most likely to have disputed claims

# DATA PROFILE & PRIOR WORK

# DATASET 1: CFPB complaints, from data.gov
# https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database

# The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency that protects American citizens in the financial
# sector. Consumers can find detailed, easy-to-understand documentation (such as mortgage lending), as well as lodge
# complaints against institutions. Their mission is "We protect, promote, and preserve the financial wellbeing of the 
# American consumer."

# Consumer complaints are logged and documented. 1.5 milion of complaints - including metadata, the verbatims, and 
# complaint resolution status. This data is well-suited to understand which companies

# As a new homeowner who had to go through mortgage process, and major Warren fan, I am curious to explore what qualities
# of complaints (as seen in the verbatims) are most likely to be resolved (by reviewing the company public response.)


# DATASET 2: state population 2010-2019, from census.gov
# https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html

# As the CFPB contains state information, I will tie state population data to complaint data to see which state residents
# are most likely to make complaints with the CFPB.

# CONCLUSIONS

# 1. Which companies have the most complaints?
#     The 3 major creit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Transunion) have the most complaints lodged by consumers.
    
# 2. What are the most common complaint categories for the credit bureaus?
#     Unsurprisingly, credit reports and credit repair services were the most common complaints for the credit bureaus.
#     Debt collection was a distant third.
#     All other types of complaints had near 0% totals.
    
# 3. Have credit bureau complaints been consistent across time, or have they changed?
#     Complaints from consumers have risen since the beginning of data collection.
#     This likely reflects overall increase of complaints as more consumers become aware of the CFPB.

# 4. Identify which of the 3 credit bureaus are most likely to respond in a timely manner to complaints
#     Most complaints, regardless of company, were responded to in a timely manner.
#         Experian was most likely to have a timely response, with 99.99% of complaints responded to in a timely manner.
#         Transunion was the next most likely to have a timely response, with 99.93% of complaints responded to in a timely manner.
#         Equifax was the least likely to have a timely response, with 99.88% of complaints responded to in a timely manner.

# 5. Identify the most common outcomes of complaints to the 3 credit bureaus
#     The most common outcomes were closed with explanation, and then closed with non-monetary relief.
#     Equifax was the most likely to continue having complaints in progress.

# 6. Identify which of the 3 credit bureaus are most likely to have disputed claims
#     Equifax was most likely to have disputed claims, with 20.83% of complaints disputed.
#     Transunion was the next most likely to have disputed claims, with 14.09% of complaints disputed.
#     Experian was the least likely to have disputed claims, with 11.68% of complaints disputed.


# DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

# The logical extension of this work would be to analyze the verbatims provided by consumers with Machine Learning techniques
# to identify which words, phrasing, or other features contribute to the best outcomes from consumer complaints.

# With approval, I would like to use this same data set to approach this particular issue.
