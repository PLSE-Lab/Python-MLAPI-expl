# Goal : complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
dir = "../input/"
train_df = pd.read_csv(dir+"train.csv")

#test_df.head()
#test_df.info()
train_df.describe()
# How many passengers survived?
ax = sns.countplot(x="Survived", data=train_df)
