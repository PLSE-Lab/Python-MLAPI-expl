# # NFL Last Man Standing Betting Strategy

# ## Purpose
# 
# The last man standing is betting game that last the duration of the NFL season.  
# * Each bettor chooses one team to win each week.  
# * If the team looses, then bettor is knocked out.  
# * The bettor cannot choose the same team twice.  
# * The last bettor alive wins the pot.  
# 
# The purpose of this analysis is to compare betting strategies within a pool of contestants.  In particular, selecting a favorite may increase the chance for survival to the next week, but not maximize that chance of winning the pool that year (since many other contestants will do the same thing).  Is there another betting strategy that is more likely to optimize the change of winning the pool?
