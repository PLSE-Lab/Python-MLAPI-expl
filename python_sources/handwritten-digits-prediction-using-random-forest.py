# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('../input/digitsdata/digits.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:,:-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:,40].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)


# In[ ]:


# Using RandomForest as the prediction is more accurate and optimal than other classifiers 
#Increasing the number n_estimators will increase the accuracy of the prediction but will result in overfitting, 10 is optimal for this dataset size
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 10, criterion = 'entropy', random_state = 0)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Making the Confusion Matrix of find the number of incorrect predictions
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

#Displaying the confusion matrix, there are two incorrect predictions.
