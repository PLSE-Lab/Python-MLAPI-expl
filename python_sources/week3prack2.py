# Question 1

# 2^10                  O(1)
# 2 long(n)             O(log(n))
# 3n + 100log(n)        O(n)
# 4n                    O(n)
# nlog(n)               O(n log(n))
# 4n log(n) + 2n        O(n Log(n))
# n^2 + 10n             O(n^2)
# n^3                   O(n^3)
# 2^n                   O(2^n)


# Question 2

# Let 8n log(n) = 2n^2
# Therefore, 4log(n) = n
# 4 log(16) = 4 * 4
#    = 16
# Therefore A is faster when n >= 16


# Question 3

# d(n) = O(f(n)),

# 2 operations outside of the loop, then 3 operations inside the loop which will each happen
# on each iteration of the loop determined by the length on s, 'n'.

# Loop only iterates for half the length of n due to the increment of 2
# in the loop condition.
