# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session
# numpy crash course

# define an array
import numpy
mylist = [1, 2, 3]
myarray = numpy.array(mylist)
print(myarray)
print(myarray.shape)

# access values
import numpy
mylist = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]]
myarray = numpy.array(mylist)
print(myarray)
print(myarray.shape)
print("First row: %s" % myarray[0])
print("Last row: %s" % myarray[-1])
print("Specific row and col: %s" % myarray[0, 2])
print("Whole col: %s" % myarray[:, 2])

# arithmetic
import numpy
myarray1 = numpy.array([2, 2, 2])
myarray2 = numpy.array([3, 3, 3])
print("Addition: %s" % (myarray1 + myarray2))
print("Multiplication: %s" % (myarray1 * myarray2))
