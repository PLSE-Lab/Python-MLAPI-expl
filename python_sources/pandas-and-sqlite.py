# Simple example of reading this dataset into Pandas from the SQLite (database.sqlite) file and adding the response id (rid) and response name (rname) to comment.

import sqlite3


import warnings # current version of seaborn generates a bunch of warnings that we'll ignore
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

con = sqlite3.connect('../input/database.sqlite')

# There are 4 tables
post = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM post", con)
comment = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM comment", con)
like = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM like", con)

# We don't want url. That just displays the image for the person.
# Also need a column name change.
rmember = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT distinct id as rid, name  rname FROM member", con)

# We'll update comment to add the response name (rname) to comment
