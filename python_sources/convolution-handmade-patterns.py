# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import pyarrow.parquet as pq #data reading

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#In the power signals there are lot of verticals lines. These flucuations are seen in non faulty and faulty lines.

#It is clearly visible that the voltage is following exponential decay pattern.

#Convluing with pattern will help detect  presense of these pattern. Let us see how it performs.

# The red portion is removed from signal. 
# This denosing has **preserved all other variations** ( before 200000 and 600000). 
# We can define more patterns and extract the features.
# We can use **CNN with filter size of 10** as smaller filters will remove almost all variations.
