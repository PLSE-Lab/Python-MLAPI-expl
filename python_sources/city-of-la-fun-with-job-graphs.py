# ## City of LA - Fun with Job Graphs

# ### This is a spin-off of my main kernel:
# ####    https://www.kaggle.com/silverfoxdss/city-of-la-readability-and-promotion-nudges
# 
# #### I have been creating a dataset with a rough first shot at the relationships between the positions and the requirements for the positions. It's not perfect and my methods have evolved as I've completed the dataset.  I'll be adding more rows to the dataset over the next couple of weeks. Some data is aquired from the job maps provided, some by the text and pdfs.
# 
# ####  https://www.kaggle.com/silverfoxdss/city-of-la-job-graph
# 
# #### My goal is to have fun and create some sort of interactive experience where a prospect can enter some sort of information and a graph will be created of those opportunities closest to the inquiry.

# 1. Create the graph
g = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(job_graph, source = 'Job_1', target = 'Job_2', edge_attr=None, create_using=None)

# 2. Create a layout for our nodes 
layout = nx.spring_layout(g,iterations=20)

# 3. Draw the parts we want
# Edges thin and grey
# Jobs_1 small and grey
# Promotions sized according to their number of connections
# Promotions blue
# Labels for Promotions ONLY
# Promotions that are highly connected are a highlighted color

# Go through every promotion ask the graph how many
# connections it has. Multiply that by 80 to get the circle size
promotion_size = [g.degree(Job_2) * 80 for Job_2 in promotions]
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g, 
                       layout,

                       node_size=promotion_size, # a LIST of sizes, based on g.degree
                       node_color='lightblue')

# Draw all jobs
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g, layout, nodelist=jobs, node_color='#cccccc', node_size=100)

# Draw all jobs with most promotional ops
