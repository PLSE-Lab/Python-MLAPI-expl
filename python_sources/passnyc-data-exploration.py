#####For Economic need index
school.boxplot(column = 'Economic Need Index')
Q1 = school['Economic Need Index'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = school['Economic Need Index'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

print("There are ",e*100/1272,"% outliers in the variable - Economic Need Index")
#there are 1.3 percent outliers in the column Economic Need Index.
